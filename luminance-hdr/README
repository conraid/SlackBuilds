Luminance HDR (HDR imaging tool)

Luminance HDR creates an HDR file from a set of images (JPEG, RAW,
TIFF 8 and 16 bit) of the same scene taken at different exposure
settings. You can save and load HDR images, rotate and resize them,
tonemap your images, and copy your EXIF data.

Luminance HDR was formerly named qtpfsgui.
