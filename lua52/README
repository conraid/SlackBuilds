Lua 5.2.* (powerful,fast,light-weight,embeddable scripting language)

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description 
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.
Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a 
register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management
with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for
configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.
