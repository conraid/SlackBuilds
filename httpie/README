httpie (modern command line HTTP client)

HTTPie (pronounced aitch-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP client.
Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as
human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command that
allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural
syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing,
debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.
