sniffit (Historical packet sniffer and monitoring tool)

sniffit is a packet sniffer for TCP/UDP/ICMP packets over IPv4. It is
able to give you a very detailed technical info on these packets, as
SEQ, ACK, TTL, Window, etc. The packet contents also can be viewed,
in different formats (hex or plain text, etc.).
