urlgrabber (cross-protocol url-grabber and Python library)

urlgrabber is a pure python package that drastically simplifies the
fetching of files. It is designed to be used in programs that need
common (but not necessarily simple) url-fetching features. It is
extremely simple to drop into an existing program and provides a
clean interface to protocol-independant file-access.
