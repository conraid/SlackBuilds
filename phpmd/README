phpmd (PHP Mass Detector)

It is a spin-off project of PHP Depend and aims to be a PHP
equivalent of the well known Java tool PMD. PHPMD can be seen as an
user friendly and easy to configure frontend for the raw metrics
measured by PHP Depend.
What PHPMD does is: It takes a given PHP source code base and look
for several potential problems within that source.
