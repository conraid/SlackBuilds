virt-viewer (display the graphical console for a virtual machine)

Virt Viewer is a minimal tool for displaying the graphical console
of a virtual machine. The console is accessed using the VNC or SPICE
protocol. The guest can be referred to based on its name, ID , or UUID
If the guest is not already running, then the viewer can be told to
wait until is starts before attempting to connect to the console.
The viewer can connect to remote hosts to lookup the console
information and then also connect to the remote console using the
same network transport.
