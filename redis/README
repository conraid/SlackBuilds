Redis (Key-Value Store)

Redis is an advanced key-value store.  It is similar to memcached but
the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like
in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.  These data
types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop elements,
add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection,
Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or a fixed-length array.
Redis supports different kinds of sorting abilities.
