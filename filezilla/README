filezilla (the free FTP solution)

filezilla is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS, and SFTP
client with lots of useful features and an intuitive user interface.

HOME: http://filezilla-project.org/

======================================================================
NOTE: 

Unfortunately I can’t provide a direct download link,
because one of the parameters changes daily.
You need to go to the website, copy the updated link,
and download the software directly.

REQUIRES: libfilezilla pugixml wxwidgets
