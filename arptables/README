arptables (administration tool for arp packet filtering)

Arptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of ARP
packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may
be defined. Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may
also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.
Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is
called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in
the same table.
