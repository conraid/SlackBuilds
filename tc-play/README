tc-play (TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt Implementation based on dm-crypt)

tcplay is a free (BSD-licensed), pretty much fully featured
(including multiple keyfiles, cipher cascades, etc) and stable
TrueCrypt implementation.
This implementation supports mapping (opening) both system and normal
TrueCrypt volumes. as well as opening hidden volumes and opening an
outer volume while protecting a hidden volume. There is also support
to create volumes, including hidden volumes, etc. Since version 1.1,
there is also support for restoring from the backup header, change
passphrase, keyfile and PBKDF2 PRF function.
