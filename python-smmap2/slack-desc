# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-smmap2: smmap2 (A sliding memory map manager)
python-smmap2:
python-smmap2: Smmap wraps an interface around mmap and tracks the mapped files as
python-smmap2: well as the amount of clients who use it. If the system runs out of
python-smmap2: resources, or if a memory limit is reached, it will automatically
python-smmap2: unload unused maps to allow continued operation.
