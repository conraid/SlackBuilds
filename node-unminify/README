node-unminify (reverse transformations applied by minifiers)

A little project to undo several of the horrible things JavaScript
build tools will do to JavaScript. In addition to undoing most
minification, it reverses some of the stupider but surprisingly
common "obfuscation" techniques used in the wild.
