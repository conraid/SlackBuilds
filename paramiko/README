paramiko (Python SSH module)

Paramiko is a combination of the esperanto words for paranoid and
friend. It's a module for python that implements the SSH2 protocol
for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote
machines. Unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require
heirarchical certificates signed by a powerful central authority.
