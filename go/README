go (Google's Go Language kit with gc tool chain)

The Go programming language is an open source project to make
programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
