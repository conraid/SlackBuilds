ctunnel  (Crypto Tunnel for Proxying and Forwarding TCP Connections)

ctunnel is a software for proxying and forwarding TCP connections
via a cryptographic tunnel.
ctunnel can be used to secure any existing TCP based protocol, such 
as HTTP, VNC, Telnet, FTP, RSH, MySQL, etc. 
You can even tunnel SSH! (if you are really paranoid!).
You can also chain/bounce connections to any number of intermediary 
hosts.
