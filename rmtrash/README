rmtrash (trash-put made compatible with GNU's rm and rmdir)

Put files (and directories) in trash using the trash-put command from
trash-cli, in a way that (unlike trash-put itself) is compatible with
GNU's rm and rmdir.

HOME: https://github.com/PhrozenByte/rmtrash/

======================================================================
NOTE: 

If you don't want to readjust the usage of rm and rmdir, a bash alias is probably a great solution for you. Just add the lines

alias rm='rmtrash'
alias rmdir='rmdirtrash'
alias sudo='sudo '

to your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_aliases). Consider adding the --forbid-root option (see replacement option below)! The last line is optional, without you'll notice that rmtrash and rmdirtrash won't be called when using sudo.

======================
REQUIRES: python-trash-cli
