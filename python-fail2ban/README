Fail2Ban (bans IP that makes too many password failures)

Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/pwdfail and bans IP
that makes too many password failures. It updates firewall
rules to reject the IP address. These rules can be defined by
the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files such as sshd,
Apache web server, postfix and others.
