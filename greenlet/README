greenlet (micro-threads for Python)

The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of
CPython that supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run
pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)
and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".

Greenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent
programming. They are provided as a C extension module for the
regular unmodified interpreter.
