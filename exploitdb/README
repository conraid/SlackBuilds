exploitdb (The official Exploit Database repository)

The Exploit Database is an archive of public exploits and
corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration
testers and vulnerability researchers. Its aim is to serve as the
most comprehensive collection of exploits, shellcode and papers
gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, and other public
sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate
database.
