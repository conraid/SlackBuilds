gst-plugins-ugly (GStreamer ugly plugins)

GStreamer Ugly Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that have good quality
and correct functionality, but distributing them might pose problems.
The license on either the plug-ins or the supporting libraries might
not be how we'd like. The code might be widely known to present
patent problems.
