gif2png (Convert GIFs to PNGs)

The gif2png program converts files from the Graphic Interchange Format
(GIF) to Portable Network Graphics (PNG). This distribution also
supplies web2png, a Python front end for gif2png which automagically
converts entire web hierarchies (the graphics files themselves and
references to them in web pages).
