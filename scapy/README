Scapy (interactive packet manipulation tool)

Scapy is a packet generator, network scanner, network discovery tool,
and packet sniffer. It provides classes to interactively create 
packets or sets of packets, manipulate them, send them over the wire,
sniff other packets from the wire, match answers and replies, and more
Interaction is provided by the Python interpreter, so Python 
programming structures can be used (such as variables, loops, and 
functions). Report modules are possible and easy to make.
