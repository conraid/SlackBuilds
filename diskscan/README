diskscan (Scan HDD/SSD for failed and near failed sectors)

DiskScan scans the entire surface of a disk, alerts when a sector is
unreadable, and uses the read timing to warn when a sector is having
problems.
It will tell when a disk has failed and already has bad sectors and
also when the disk is near failure and takes too long to read the
data.
