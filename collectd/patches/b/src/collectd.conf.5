.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This config file controls how the system statistics collection daemon
\&\fBcollectd\fR behaves. The most significant option is \fBLoadPlugin\fR, which
controls which plugins to load. These plugins ultimately define collectd's
behavior. If the \fBAutoLoadPlugin\fR option has been enabled, the explicit
\&\fBLoadPlugin\fR lines may be omitted for all plugins with a configuration block,
i.e. a \f(CW\*(C`<Plugin\ ...>\*(C'\fR block.
.PP
The syntax of this config file is similar to the config file of the famous
\&\fIApache\fR webserver. Each line contains either an option (a key and a list of
one or more values) or a section-start or \-end. Empty lines and everything
after a non-quoted hash-symbol (\f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR) are ignored. \fIKeys\fR are unquoted
strings, consisting only of alphanumeric characters and the underscore (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR)
character. Keys are handled case insensitive by \fIcollectd\fR itself and all
plugins included with it. \fIValues\fR can either be an \fIunquoted string\fR, a
\&\fIquoted string\fR (enclosed in double-quotes) a \fInumber\fR or a \fIboolean\fR
expression. \fIUnquoted strings\fR consist of only alphanumeric characters and
underscores (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR) and do not need to be quoted. \fIQuoted strings\fR are
enclosed in double quotes (\f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR). You can use the backslash character (\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR)
to include double quotes as part of the string. \fINumbers\fR can be specified in
decimal and floating point format (using a dot \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR as decimal separator),
hexadecimal when using the \f(CW\*(C`0x\*(C'\fR prefix and octal with a leading zero (\f(CW0\fR).
\&\fIBoolean\fR values are either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR.
.PP
Lines may be wrapped by using \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR as the last character before the newline.
This allows long lines to be split into multiple lines. Quoted strings may be
wrapped as well. However, those are treated special in that whitespace at the
beginning of the following lines will be ignored, which allows for nicely
indenting the wrapped lines.
.PP
The configuration is read and processed in order, i.e. from top to bottom. So
the plugins are loaded in the order listed in this config file. It is a good
idea to load any logging plugins first in order to catch messages from plugins
during configuration. Also, unless \fBAutoLoadPlugin\fR is enabled, the
\&\fBLoadPlugin\fR option \fImust\fR occur \fIbefore\fR the appropriate
\&\f(CW\*(C`<\f(CBPlugin\f(CW ...>\*(C'\fR block.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IP "\fBBaseDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "BaseDir Directory"
Sets the base directory. This is the directory beneath which all RRD-files are
created. Possibly more subdirectories are created. This is also the working
directory for the daemon.
.IP "\fBLoadPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "LoadPlugin Plugin"
Loads the plugin \fIPlugin\fR. This is required to load plugins, unless the
\&\fBAutoLoadPlugin\fR option is enabled (see below). Without any loaded plugins,
\&\fIcollectd\fR will be mostly useless.
.Sp
Only the first \fBLoadPlugin\fR statement or block for a given plugin name has any
effect. This is useful when you want to split up the configuration into smaller
files and want each file to be \*(L"self contained\*(R", i.e. it contains a \fBPlugin\fR
block \fIand\fR the appropriate \fBLoadPlugin\fR statement. The downside is that if
you have multiple conflicting \fBLoadPlugin\fR blocks, e.g. when they specify
different intervals, only one of them (the first one encountered) will take
effect and all others will be silently ignored.
.Sp
\&\fBLoadPlugin\fR may either be a simple configuration \fIstatement\fR or a \fIblock\fR
with additional options, affecting the behavior of \fBLoadPlugin\fR. A simple
statement looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& LoadPlugin "cpu"
.Ve
.Sp
Options inside a \fBLoadPlugin\fR block can override default settings and
influence the way plugins are loaded, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& <LoadPlugin perl>
\&   Interval 60
\& </LoadPlugin>
.Ve
.Sp
The following options are valid inside \fBLoadPlugin\fR blocks:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBGlobals\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "Globals true|false"
If enabled, collectd will export all global symbols of the plugin (and of all
libraries loaded as dependencies of the plugin) and, thus, makes those symbols
available for resolving unresolved symbols in subsequently loaded plugins if
that is supported by your system.
.Sp
This is useful (or possibly even required), e.g., when loading a plugin that
embeds some scripting language into the daemon (e.g. the \fIPerl\fR and
\&\fIPython plugins\fR). Scripting languages usually provide means to load
extensions written in C. Those extensions require symbols provided by the
interpreter, which is loaded as a dependency of the respective collectd plugin.
See the documentation of those plugins (e.g., \fBcollectd\-perl\fR\|(5) or
\&\fBcollectd\-python\fR\|(5)) for details.
.Sp
By default, this is disabled. As a special exception, if the plugin name is
either \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`python\*(C'\fR, the default is changed to enabled in order to keep
the average user from ever having to deal with this low level linking stuff.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval Seconds"
Sets a plugin-specific interval for collecting metrics. This overrides the
global \fBInterval\fR setting. If a plugin provides its own support for specifying
an interval, that setting will take precedence.
.IP "\fBFlushInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "FlushInterval Seconds"
Specifies the interval, in seconds, to call the flush callback if it's
defined in this plugin. By default, this is disabled.
.IP "\fBFlushTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "FlushTimeout Seconds"
Specifies the value of the timeout argument of the flush callback.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBAutoLoadPlugin\fR \fBfalse\fR|\fBtrue\fR" 4
.IX Item "AutoLoadPlugin false|true"
When set to \fBfalse\fR (the default), each plugin needs to be loaded explicitly,
using the \fBLoadPlugin\fR statement documented above. If a
\&\fB<Plugin\ ...>\fR block is encountered and no configuration
handling callback for this plugin has been registered, a warning is logged and
the block is ignored.
.Sp
When set to \fBtrue\fR, explicit \fBLoadPlugin\fR statements are not required. Each
\&\fB<Plugin\ ...>\fR block acts as if it was immediately preceded by a
\&\fBLoadPlugin\fR statement. \fBLoadPlugin\fR statements are still required for
plugins that don't provide any configuration, e.g. the \fILoad plugin\fR.
.IP "\fBCollectInternalStats\fR \fBfalse\fR|\fBtrue\fR" 4
.IX Item "CollectInternalStats false|true"
When set to \fBtrue\fR, various statistics about the \fIcollectd\fR daemon will be
collected, with \*(L"collectd\*(R" as the \fIplugin name\fR. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.Sp
The following metrics are reported:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """collectd\-write_queue/queue_length""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWcollectd\-write_queue/queue_length\fR" 4
.IX Item "collectd-write_queue/queue_length"
The number of metrics currently in the write queue. You can limit the queue
length with the \fBWriteQueueLimitLow\fR and \fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR options.
.ie n .IP """collectd\-write_queue/derive\-dropped""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWcollectd\-write_queue/derive\-dropped\fR" 4
.IX Item "collectd-write_queue/derive-dropped"
The number of metrics dropped due to a queue length limitation.
If this value is non-zero, your system can't handle all incoming metrics and
protects itself against overload by dropping metrics.
.ie n .IP """collectd\-cache/cache_size""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWcollectd\-cache/cache_size\fR" 4
.IX Item "collectd-cache/cache_size"
The number of elements in the metric cache (the cache you can interact with
using \fBcollectd\-unixsock\fR\|(5)).
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBInclude\fR \fIPath\fR [\fIpattern\fR]" 4
.IX Item "Include Path [pattern]"
If \fIPath\fR points to a file, includes that file. If \fIPath\fR points to a
directory, recursively includes all files within that directory and its
subdirectories. If the \f(CW\*(C`wordexp\*(C'\fR function is available on your system,
shell-like wildcards are expanded before files are included. This means you can
use statements like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Include "/etc/collectd.d/*.conf"
.Ve
.Sp
Starting with version 5.3, this may also be a block in which further options
affecting the behavior of \fBInclude\fR may be specified. The following option is
currently allowed:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  <Include "/etc/collectd.d">
\&    Filter "*.conf"
\&  </Include>
.Ve
.RS 4
.IP "\fBFilter\fR \fIpattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "Filter pattern"
If the \f(CW\*(C`fnmatch\*(C'\fR function is available on your system, a shell-like wildcard
\&\fIpattern\fR may be specified to filter which files to include. This may be used
in combination with recursively including a directory to easily be able to
arbitrarily mix configuration files and other documents (e.g. \s-1README\s0 files).
The given example is similar to the first example above but includes all files
matching \f(CW\*(C`*.conf\*(C'\fR in any subdirectory of \f(CW\*(C`/etc/collectd.d\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If more than one file is included by a single \fBInclude\fR option, the files
will be included in lexicographical order (as defined by the \f(CW\*(C`strcmp\*(C'\fR
function). Thus, you can e.\ g. use numbered prefixes to specify the
order in which the files are loaded.
.Sp
To prevent loops and shooting yourself in the foot in interesting ways the
nesting is limited to a depth of 8\ levels, which should be sufficient for
most uses. Since symlinks are followed it is still possible to crash the daemon
by looping symlinks. In our opinion significant stupidity should result in an
appropriate amount of pain.
.Sp
It is no problem to have a block like \f(CW\*(C`<Plugin foo>\*(C'\fR in more than one
file, but you cannot include files from within blocks.
.RE
.IP "\fBPIDFile\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "PIDFile File"
Sets where to write the \s-1PID\s0 file to. This file is overwritten when it exists
and deleted when the program is stopped. Some init-scripts might override this
setting using the \fB\-P\fR command-line option.
.IP "\fBPluginDir\fR \fIDirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "PluginDir Directory"
Path to the plugins (shared objects) of collectd.
.IP "\fBTypesDB\fR \fIFile\fR [\fIFile\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "TypesDB File [File ...]"
Set one or more files that contain the data-set descriptions. See
\&\fBtypes.db\fR\|(5) for a description of the format of this file.
.Sp
If this option is not specified, a default file is read. If you need to define
custom types in addition to the types defined in the default file, you need to
explicitly load both. In other words, if the \fBTypesDB\fR option is encountered
the default behavior is disabled and if you need the default types you have to
also explicitly load them.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval Seconds"
Configures the interval in which to query the read plugins. Obviously smaller
values lead to a higher system load produced by collectd, while higher values
lead to more coarse statistics.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR You should set this once and then never touch it again. If you do,
\&\fIyou will have to delete all your \s-1RRD\s0 files\fR or know some serious RRDtool
magic! (Assuming you're using the \fIRRDtool\fR or \fIRRDCacheD\fR plugin.)
.IP "\fBMaxReadInterval\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "MaxReadInterval Seconds"
A read plugin doubles the interval between queries after each failed attempt
to get data.
.Sp
This options limits the maximum value of the interval. The default value is
\&\fB86400\fR.
.IP "\fBTimeout\fR \fIIterations\fR" 4
.IX Item "Timeout Iterations"
Consider a value list \*(L"missing\*(R" when no update has been read or received for
\&\fIIterations\fR iterations. By default, \fIcollectd\fR considers a value list
missing when no update has been received for twice the update interval. Since
this setting uses iterations, the maximum allowed time without update depends
on the \fIInterval\fR information contained in each value list. This is used in
the \fIThreshold\fR configuration to dispatch notifications about missing values,
see \fBcollectd\-threshold\fR\|(5) for details.
.IP "\fBReadThreads\fR \fINum\fR" 4
.IX Item "ReadThreads Num"
Number of threads to start for reading plugins. The default value is \fB5\fR, but
you may want to increase this if you have more than five plugins that take a
long time to read. Mostly those are plugins that do network-IO. Setting this to
a value higher than the number of registered read callbacks is not recommended.
.IP "\fBWriteThreads\fR \fINum\fR" 4
.IX Item "WriteThreads Num"
Number of threads to start for dispatching value lists to write plugins. The
default value is \fB5\fR, but you may want to increase this if you have more than
five plugins that may take relatively long to write to.
.IP "\fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR \fIHighNum\fR" 4
.IX Item "WriteQueueLimitHigh HighNum"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWriteQueueLimitLow\fR \fILowNum\fR" 4
.IX Item "WriteQueueLimitLow LowNum"
.PD
Metrics are read by the \fIread threads\fR and then put into a queue to be handled
by the \fIwrite threads\fR. If one of the \fIwrite plugins\fR is slow (e.g. network
timeouts, I/O saturation of the disk) this queue will grow. In order to avoid
running into memory issues in such a case, you can limit the size of this
queue.
.Sp
By default, there is no limit and memory may grow indefinitely. This is most
likely not an issue for clients, i.e. instances that only handle the local
metrics. For servers it is recommended to set this to a non-zero value, though.
.Sp
You can set the limits using \fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR and \fBWriteQueueLimitLow\fR.
Each of them takes a numerical argument which is the number of metrics in the
queue. If there are \fIHighNum\fR metrics in the queue, any new metrics \fIwill\fR be
dropped. If there are less than \fILowNum\fR metrics in the queue, all new metrics
\&\fIwill\fR be enqueued. If the number of metrics currently in the queue is between
\&\fILowNum\fR and \fIHighNum\fR, the metric is dropped with a probability that is
proportional to the number of metrics in the queue (i.e. it increases linearly
until it reaches 100%.)
.Sp
If \fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR is set to non-zero and \fBWriteQueueLimitLow\fR is
unset, the latter will default to half of \fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR.
.Sp
If you do not want to randomly drop values when the queue size is between
\&\fILowNum\fR and \fIHighNum\fR, set \fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR and \fBWriteQueueLimitLow\fR
to the same value.
.Sp
Enabling the \fBCollectInternalStats\fR option is of great help to figure out the
values to set \fBWriteQueueLimitHigh\fR and \fBWriteQueueLimitLow\fR to.
.IP "\fBHostname\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hostname Name"
Sets the hostname that identifies a host. If you omit this setting, the
hostname will be determined using the \fBgethostname\fR\|(2) system call.
.IP "\fBFQDNLookup\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "FQDNLookup true|false"
If \fBHostname\fR is determined automatically this setting controls whether or not
the daemon should try to figure out the \*(L"fully qualified domain name\*(R", \s-1FQDN.\s0
This is done using a lookup of the name returned by \f(CW\*(C`gethostname\*(C'\fR. This option
is enabled by default.
.IP "\fBPreCacheChain\fR \fIChainName\fR" 4

.SH "PLUGIN OPTIONS"
.IX Header "PLUGIN OPTIONS"
Some plugins may register own options. These options must be enclosed in a
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR\-Section. Which options exist depends on the plugin used. Some plugins
require external configuration, too. The \f(CW\*(C`apache plugin\*(C'\fR, for example,
required \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR to be configured in the webserver you're going to
collect data from. These plugins are listed below as well, even if they don't
require any configuration within collectd's configuration file.
.PP
A list of all plugins and a short summary for each plugin can be found in the
\&\fI\s-1README\s0\fR file shipped with the sourcecode and hopefully binary packets as
well.
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""aggregation"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWaggregation\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin aggregation"
The \fIAggregation plugin\fR makes it possible to aggregate several values into
one using aggregation functions such as \fIsum\fR, \fIaverage\fR, \fImin\fR and \fImax\fR.
This can be put to a wide variety of uses, e.g. average and total \s-1CPU\s0
statistics for your entire fleet.
.PP
The grouping is powerful but, as with many powerful tools, may be a bit
difficult to wrap your head around. The grouping will therefore be
demonstrated using an example: The average and sum of the \s-1CPU\s0 usage across
all CPUs of each host is to be calculated.
.PP
To select all the affected values for our example, set \f(CW\*(C`Plugin cpu\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Type cpu\*(C'\fR. The other values are left unspecified, meaning \*(L"all values\*(R". The
\&\fIHost\fR, \fIPlugin\fR, \fIPluginInstance\fR, \fIType\fR and \fITypeInstance\fR options
work as if they were specified in the \f(CW\*(C`WHERE\*(C'\fR clause of an \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR \s-1SQL\s0
statement.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  Plugin "cpu"
\&  Type "cpu"
.Ve
.PP
Although the \fIHost\fR, \fIPluginInstance\fR (\s-1CPU\s0 number, i.e. 0, 1, 2, ...)  and
\&\fITypeInstance\fR (idle, user, system, ...) fields are left unspecified in the
example, the intention is to have a new value for each host / type instance
pair. This is achieved by \*(L"grouping\*(R" the values using the \f(CW\*(C`GroupBy\*(C'\fR option.
It can be specified multiple times to group by more than one field.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  GroupBy "Host"
\&  GroupBy "TypeInstance"
.Ve
.PP
We do neither specify nor group by \fIplugin instance\fR (the \s-1CPU\s0 number), so all
metrics that differ in the \s-1CPU\s0 number only will be aggregated. Each
aggregation needs \fIat least one\fR such field, otherwise no aggregation would
take place.

There are a couple of limitations you should be aware of:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \fIType\fR cannot be left unspecified, because it is not reasonable to add
apples to oranges. Also, the internal lookup structure won't work if you try
to group by type.
.IP "\(bu" 4
There must be at least one unspecified, ungrouped field. Otherwise nothing
will be aggregated.
.PP
As you can see in the example above, each aggregation has its own
\&\fBAggregation\fR block. You can have multiple aggregation blocks and aggregation
blocks may match the same values, i.e. one value list can update multiple
aggregations. The following options are valid inside \fBAggregation\fR blocks:
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHost\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Host"

.IP "\fBType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "Type Type"
.IP "\fBTypeInstance\fR \fITypeInstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "TypeInstance TypeInstance"
.PD
Selects the value lists to be added to this aggregation. \fBType\fR must be a
valid data set name, see \fBtypes.db\fR\|(5) for details.
.Sp
If the string starts with and ends with a slash (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR), the string is
interpreted as a \fIregular expression\fR. The regex flavor used are \s-1POSIX\s0
extended regular expressions as described in \fBregex\fR\|(7). Example usage:
.Sp

.IX Item "GroupBy Host|Plugin|PluginInstance|TypeInstance"
Group valued by the specified field. The \fBGroupBy\fR option may be repeated to
group by multiple fields.

.IP "\fBSetTypeInstance\fR \fITypeInstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "SetTypeInstance TypeInstance"
.PD
Sets the appropriate part of the identifier to the provided string.
.Sp
The \fIPluginInstance\fR should include the placeholder \f(CW\*(C`%{aggregation}\*(C'\fR which
will be replaced with the aggregation function, e.g. \*(L"average\*(R". Not including
the placeholder will result in duplication warnings and/or messed up values if
more than one aggregation function are enabled.
.Sp
The following example calculates the average usage of all \*(L"even\*(R" CPUs:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& <Plugin "aggregation">

The plugin's configuration consists of a number of \fIPublish\fR and \fISubscribe\fR
blocks, which configure sending and receiving of values respectively. The two
blocks are very similar, so unless otherwise noted, an option can be used in
either block. The name given in the blocks starting tag is only used for
reporting messages, but may be used to support \fIflushing\fR of certain
\&\fIPublish\fR blocks in the future.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHost\fR [\fIHost\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "Host Host [Host ...]"
Hostname or IP-address of the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker. Defaults to the default behavior of
the underlying communications library, \fIrabbitmq-c\fR, which is \*(L"localhost\*(R".
.Sp
If multiple hosts are specified, then a random one is chosen at each
(re)connection attempt. This is useful for failover with a clustered broker.
.IP "\fBPort\fR \fIPort\fR" 4
.IX Item "Port Port"
Service name or port number on which the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker accepts connections. This
argument must be a string, even if the numeric form is used. Defaults to
\&\*(L"5672\*(R".
.IP "\fBVHost\fR \fIVHost\fR" 4
.IX Item "VHost VHost"
Name of the \fIvirtual host\fR on the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker to use. Defaults to \*(L"/\*(R".
.IP "\fBUser\fR \fIUser\fR" 4
.IX Item "User User"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBPassword\fR \fIPassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "Password Password"
.PD
Credentials used to authenticate to the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker. By default \*(L"guest\*(R"/\*(L"guest\*(R"
is used.
.IP "\fBExchange\fR \fIExchange\fR" 4
.IX Item "Exchange Exchange"
In \fIPublish\fR blocks, this option specifies the \fIexchange\fR to send values to.
By default, \*(L"amq.fanout\*(R" will be used.
.Sp
In \fISubscribe\fR blocks this option is optional. If given, a \fIbinding\fR between
the given exchange and the \fIqueue\fR is created, using the \fIrouting key\fR if
configured. See the \fBQueue\fR and \fBRoutingKey\fR options below.
.IP "\fBExchangeType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "ExchangeType Type"
If given, the plugin will try to create the configured \fIexchange\fR with this
\&\fItype\fR after connecting. When in a \fISubscribe\fR block, the \fIqueue\fR will then
be bound to this exchange.
.IP "\fBQueue\fR \fIQueue\fR (Subscribe only)" 4
.IX Item "Queue Queue (Subscribe only)"
Configures the \fIqueue\fR name to subscribe to. If no queue name was configured
explicitly, a unique queue name will be created by the broker.
.IP "\fBQueueDurable\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR (Subscribe only)" 4
.IX Item "QueueDurable true|false (Subscribe only)"
Defines if the \fIqueue\fR subscribed to is durable (saved to persistent storage)
or transient (will disappear if the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker is restarted). Defaults to
\&\*(L"false\*(R".
.Sp
This option should be used in conjunction with the \fIPersistent\fR option on the
publish side.
.IP "\fBQueueAutoDelete\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR (Subscribe only)" 4
.IX Item "QueueAutoDelete true|false (Subscribe only)"
Defines if the \fIqueue\fR subscribed to will be deleted once the last consumer
unsubscribes. Defaults to \*(L"true\*(R".
.IP "\fBRoutingKey\fR \fIKey\fR" 4
.IX Item "RoutingKey Key"
In \fIPublish\fR blocks, this configures the routing key to set on all outgoing
messages. If not given, the routing key will be computed from the \fIidentifier\fR
of the value. The host, plugin, type and the two instances are concatenated
together using dots as the separator and all containing dots replaced with
slashes. For example \*(L"collectd.host/example/com.cpu.0.cpu.user\*(R". This makes it
possible to receive only specific values using a \*(L"topic\*(R" exchange.
.Sp
In \fISubscribe\fR blocks, configures the \fIrouting key\fR used when creating a
\&\fIbinding\fR between an \fIexchange\fR and the \fIqueue\fR. The usual wildcards can be
used to filter messages when using a \*(L"topic\*(R" exchange. If you're only
interested in \s-1CPU\s0 statistics, you could use the routing key \*(L"collectd.*.cpu.#\*(R"
for example.
.IP "\fBPersistent\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR (Publish only)" 4
.IX Item "Persistent true|false (Publish only)"
Selects the \fIdelivery method\fR to use. If set to \fBtrue\fR, the \fIpersistent\fR
mode will be used, i.e. delivery is guaranteed. If set to \fBfalse\fR (the
default), the \fItransient\fR delivery mode will be used, i.e. messages may be
lost due to high load, overflowing queues or similar issues.
.IP "\fBConnectionRetryDelay\fR \fIDelay\fR" 4
.IX Item "ConnectionRetryDelay Delay"
When the connection to the \s-1AMQP\s0 broker is lost, defines the time in seconds to
wait before attempting to reconnect. Defaults to 0, which implies collectd will
attempt to reconnect at each read interval (in Subscribe mode) or each time
values are ready for submission (in Publish mode).
.IP "\fBFormat\fR \fBCommand\fR|\fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR|\fBGraphite\fR (Publish only)" 4
.IX Item "Format Command|JSON|Graphite (Publish only)"
Selects the format in which messages are sent to the broker. If set to
\&\fBCommand\fR (the default), values are sent as \f(CW\*(C`PUTVAL\*(C'\fR commands which are
identical to the syntax used by the \fIExec\fR and \fIUnixSock plugins\fR. In this
case, the \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field will be set to \f(CW\*(C`text/collectd\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If set to \fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR, the values are encoded in the \fIJavaScript Object Notation\fR,
an easy and straight forward exchange format. The \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field
will be set to \f(CW\*(C`application/json\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If set to \fBGraphite\fR, values are encoded in the \fIGraphite\fR format, which is
\&\*(L"<metric> <value> <timestamp>\en\*(R". The \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field will be set to
\&\f(CW\*(C`text/graphite\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
A subscribing client \fIshould\fR use the \f(CW\*(C`Content\-Type\*(C'\fR header field to
determine how to decode the values. Currently, the \fI\s-1AMQP\s0 plugin\fR itself can
only decode the \fBCommand\fR format.
.IP "\fBStoreRates\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR (Publish only)" 4
.IX Item "StoreRates true|false (Publish only)"
Determines whether or not \f(CW\*(C`COUNTER\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DERIVE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ABSOLUTE\*(C'\fR data sources
are converted to a \fIrate\fR (i.e. a \f(CW\*(C`GAUGE\*(C'\fR value). If set to \fBfalse\fR (the
default), no conversion is performed. Otherwise the conversion is performed
using the internal value cache.
.Sp
Please note that currently this option is only used if the \fBFormat\fR option has
been set to \fB\s-1JSON\s0\fR.
.IP "\fBGraphitePrefix\fR (Publish and \fBFormat\fR=\fIGraphite\fR only)" 4
.IX Item "GraphitePrefix (Publish and Format=Graphite only)"
A prefix can be added in the metric name when outputting in the \fIGraphite\fR format.
It's added before the \fIHost\fR name.
Metric name will be \*(L"<prefix><host><postfix><plugin><type><name>\*(R"
.IP "\fBGraphitePostfix\fR (Publish and \fBFormat\fR=\fIGraphite\fR only)" 4
.IX Item "GraphitePostfix (Publish and Format=Graphite only)"

It's added after the \fIHost\fR name.
Metric name will be \*(L"<prefix><host><postfix><plugin><type><name>\*(R"
.IP "\fBGraphiteEscapeChar\fR (Publish and \fBFormat\fR=\fIGraphite\fR only)" 4
.IX Item "GraphiteEscapeChar (Publish and Format=Graphite only)"
Specify a character to replace dots (.) in the host part of the metric name.
In \fIGraphite\fR metric name, dots are used as separators between different
metric parts (host, plugin, type).
Default is \*(L"_\*(R" (\fIUnderscore\fR).
.IP "\fBGraphiteSeparateInstances\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "GraphiteSeparateInstances true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, the plugin instance and type instance will be in their own
path component, for example \f(CW\*(C`host.cpu.0.cpu.idle\*(C'\fR. If set to \fBfalse\fR (the
default), the plugin and plugin instance (and likewise the type and type
instance) are put into one component, for example \f(CW\*(C`host.cpu\-0.cpu\-idle\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBGraphiteAlwaysAppendDS\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "GraphiteAlwaysAppendDS true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, append the name of the \fIData Source\fR (\s-1DS\s0) to the \*(L"metric\*(R"
identifier. If set to \fBfalse\fR (the default), this is only done when there is
more than one \s-1DS.\s0
.IP "\fBGraphitePreserveSeparator\fR \fBfalse\fR|\fBtrue\fR" 4
.IX Item "GraphitePreserveSeparator false|true"
If set to \fBfalse\fR (the default) the \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR (dot) character is replaced with
\&\fIGraphiteEscapeChar\fR. Otherwise, if set to \fBtrue\fR, the \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR (dot) character
is preserved, i.e. passed through.
.IP "\fBTLSEnabled\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "TLSEnabled true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR then connect to the broker using a \s-1TLS\s0 connection.

.IX Subsection "Plugin apache"
To configure the \f(CW\*(C`apache\*(C'\fR\-plugin you first need to configure the Apache
webserver correctly. The Apache-plugin \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR needs to be loaded and
working and the \f(CW\*(C`ExtendedStatus\*(C'\fR directive needs to be \fBenabled\fR. You can use
the following snipped to base your Apache config upon:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&  ExtendedStatus on
\&  <IfModule mod_status.c>
\&    <Location /mod_status>
\&      SetHandler server\-status
\&    </Location>
\&  </IfModule>
.Ve
.PP
Since its \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR module is very similar to Apache's, \fBlighttpd\fR is
also supported. It introduces a new field, called \f(CW\*(C`BusyServers\*(C'\fR, to count the
number of currently connected clients. This field is also supported.
.PP
The configuration of the \fIApache\fR plugin consists of one or more
\&\f(CW\*(C`<Instance\ />\*(C'\fR blocks. Each block requires one string argument
as the instance name. For example:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& <Plugin "apache">
\&   <Instance "www1">
\&     URL "http://www1.example.com/mod_status?auto"
\&   </Instance>
\&   <Instance "www2">
\&     URL "http://www2.example.com/mod_status?auto"
\&   </Instance>
\& </Plugin>
.Ve
.PP
The instance name will be used as the \fIplugin instance\fR. To emulate the old
(version\ 4) behavior, you can use an empty string (""). In order for the
plugin to work correctly, each instance name must be unique. This is not
enforced by the plugin and it is your responsibility to ensure it.
.PP
The following options are accepted within each \fIInstance\fR block:
.IP "\fB\s-1URL\s0\fR \fIhttp://host/mod_status?auto\fR" 4
.IX Item "URL http://host/mod_status?auto"
Sets the \s-1URL\s0 of the \f(CW\*(C`mod_status\*(C'\fR output. This needs to be the output generated

.PP
The plugin provides absolute barometric pressure, air pressure reduced to sea
level (several possible approximations) and as an auxiliary value also internal
sensor temperature. It uses (expects/provides) typical metric units \- pressure
in [hPa], temperature in [C], altitude in [m].
.PP
It was developed and tested under Linux only. The only platform dependency is
the standard Linux i2c\-dev interface (the particular bus driver has to
support the \s-1SM\s0 Bus command subset).
.PP
The reduction or normalization to mean sea level pressure requires (depending
on selected method/approximation) also altitude and reference to temperature
sensor(s).  When multiple temperature sensors are configured the minimum of
their values is always used (expecting that the warmer ones are affected by
e.g. direct sun light at that moment).

The \fBTimeout\fR option sets the overall timeout for \s-1HTTP\s0 requests to \fB\s-1URL\s0\fR, in
milliseconds. By default, the configured \fBInterval\fR is used to set the

If \fBTimeout\fR is 0 or bigger than the \fBInterval\fR, keep in mind that each slow
network connection will stall one read thread. Adjust the \fBReadThreads\fR global
setting accordingly to prevent this from blocking other plugins.

try to solve the task of generating the jolokia post data, or automatically 
map the values, but rather leans on a verbose config containing the prepared

script to filter them, and generate a configuration for you:

it can gather all interesting gauges, write a simple one value per line config 
for itself and subsequent calls.
You can remove lines from this file manually, or create filter lists. 
You then use the script to generate a collectd config. 
The script can then inspect data files from some testruns, and remove 
all gauges, that don't contain any movement.

Query blocks define \fI\s-1SQL\s0\fR statements and how the returned data should be
interpreted. They are identified by the name that is given in the opening line
of the block. Thus the name needs to be unique. Other than that, the name is
not used in collectd.

In each \fBQuery\fR block, there is one or more \fBResult\fR blocks. \fBResult\fR blocks
define which column holds which value or instance information. You can use
multiple \fBResult\fR blocks to create multiple values from one returned row. This
is especially useful, when queries take a long time and sending almost the same
query again and again is not desirable.

.Sp
The query has to return at least two columns, one for the instance and one

options to provide multiple queries with the same name but with a slightly
different syntax. The plugin will use only those queries, where the specified
minimum and maximum versions fit the version of the database in use.
.Sp
The database version is determined by \f(CW\*(C`dbi_conn_get_engine_version\*(C'\fR, see the
libdbi documentation <http://libdbi.sourceforge.net/docs/programmers-guide/reference-conn.html#DBI-CONN-GET-ENGINE-VERSION>
for details. Basically, each part of the version is assumed to be in the range
from \fB00\fR to \fB99\fR and all dots are removed. So version \*(L"4.1.2\*(R" becomes
\&\*(L"40102\*(R", version \*(L"5.0.42\*(R" becomes \*(L"50042\*(R".
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR The plugin will use \fBall\fR matching queries, so if you specify
multiple queries with the same name and \fBoverlapping\fR ranges, weird stuff will
happen. Don't to it! A valid example would be something along these lines:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  MinVersion 40000
\&  MaxVersion 49999
\&  ...
\&  MinVersion 50000
\&  MaxVersion 50099
\&  ...
\&  MinVersion 50100
\&  # No maximum
.Ve
.Sp
In the above example, there are three ranges that don't overlap. The last one
goes from version \*(L"5.1.0\*(R" to infinity, meaning \*(L"all later versions\*(R". Versions
before \*(L"4.0.0\*(R" are not specified.
.IP "\fBType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "Type Type"
The \fBtype\fR that's used for each line returned. See \fBtypes.db\fR\|(5) for more
details on how types are defined. In short: A type is a predefined layout of
data and the number of values and type of values has to match the type
definition.
.Sp
If you specify \*(L"temperature\*(R" here, you need exactly one gauge column. If you
specify \*(L"if_octets\*(R", you will need two counter columns. See the \fBValuesFrom\fR
setting below.
.Sp
There must be exactly one \fBType\fR option inside each \fBResult\fR block.
.IP "\fBInstancePrefix\fR \fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "InstancePrefix prefix"
Prepends \fIprefix\fR to the type instance. If \fBInstancesFrom\fR (see below) is not
given, the string is simply copied. If \fBInstancesFrom\fR is given, \fIprefix\fR and
all strings returned in the appropriate columns are concatenated together,
separated by dashes \fI(\*(L"\-\*(R")\fR.
.IP "\fBInstancesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "InstancesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
Specifies the columns whose values will be used to create the \*(L"type-instance\*(R"
for each row. If you specify more than one column, the value of all columns
will be joined together with dashes \fI(\*(L"\-\*(R")\fR as separation characters.
.Sp
The plugin itself does not check whether or not all built instances are
different. It's your responsibility to assure that each is unique. This is
especially true, if you do not specify \fBInstancesFrom\fR: \fBYou\fR have to make
sure that only one row is returned in this case.
.Sp
If neither \fBInstancePrefix\fR nor \fBInstancesFrom\fR is given, the type-instance
will be empty.
.IP "\fBValuesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "ValuesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
Names the columns whose content is used as the actual data for the data sets
that are dispatched to the daemon. How many such columns you need is determined
by the \fBType\fR setting above. If you specify too many or not enough columns,
the plugin will complain about that and no data will be submitted to the
daemon.
.Sp
The actual data type in the columns is not that important. The plugin will
automatically cast the values to the right type if it know how to do that. So
it should be able to handle integer an floating point types, as well as strings
(if they include a number at the beginning).
.Sp
There must be at least one \fBValuesFrom\fR option inside each \fBResult\fR block.
.IP "\fBMetadataFrom\fR [\fIcolumn0\fR \fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "MetadataFrom [column0 column1 ...]"
Names the columns whose content is used as metadata for the data sets
that are dispatched to the daemon.
.Sp
The actual data type in the columns is not that important. The plugin will
automatically cast the values to the right type if it know how to do that. So
it should be able to handle integer an floating point types, as well as strings
(if they include a number at the beginning).
.PP
\fI\f(BIDatabase\fI blocks\fR
.IX Subsection "Database blocks"
.PP
Database blocks define a connection to a database and which queries should be
sent to that database. Since the used \*(L"dbi\*(R" library can handle a wide variety
of databases, the configuration is very generic. If in doubt, refer to libdbi's
documentation\ \- we stick as close to the terminology used there.
.PP
Each database needs a \*(L"name\*(R" as string argument in the starting tag of the
block. This name will be used as \*(L"PluginInstance\*(R" in the values submitted to
the daemon. Other than that, that name is not used.
.IP "\fBPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "Plugin Plugin"
Use \fIPlugin\fR as the plugin name when submitting query results from
this \fBDatabase\fR. Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`dbi\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fIInterval\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval Interval"
Sets the interval (in seconds) in which the values will be collected from this
database. By default the global \fBInterval\fR setting will be used.
.IP "\fBDriver\fR \fIDriver\fR" 4
.IX Item "Driver Driver"
Specifies the driver to use to connect to the database. In many cases those
drivers are named after the database they can connect to, but this is not a
technical necessity. These drivers are sometimes referred to as \*(L"\s-1DBD\*(R",\s0
\&\fBD\fRata\fBB\fRase \fBD\fRriver, and some distributions ship them in separate
packages. Drivers for the \*(L"dbi\*(R" library are developed by the \fBlibdbi-drivers\fR
project at <http://libdbi\-drivers.sourceforge.net/>.
.Sp
You need to give the driver name as expected by the \*(L"dbi\*(R" library here. You
should be able to find that in the documentation for each driver. If you
mistype the driver name, the plugin will dump a list of all known driver names
to the log.
.IP "\fBDriverOption\fR \fIKey\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "DriverOption Key Value"
Sets driver-specific options. What option a driver supports can be found in the
documentation for each driver, somewhere at
<http://libdbi\-drivers.sourceforge.net/>. However, the options \*(L"host\*(R",
\&\*(L"username\*(R", \*(L"password\*(R", and \*(L"dbname\*(R" seem to be de\ facto standards.
.Sp
DBDs can register two types of options: String options and numeric options. The
plugin will use the \f(CW\*(C`dbi_conn_set_option\*(C'\fR function when the configuration
provides a string and the \f(CW\*(C`dbi_conn_require_option_numeric\*(C'\fR function when the
configuration provides a number. So these two lines will actually result in
different calls being used:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  DriverOption "Port" 1234      # numeric
\&  DriverOption "Port" "1234"    # string
.Ve
.Sp
Unfortunately, drivers are not too keen to report errors when an unknown option
is passed to them, so invalid settings here may go unnoticed. This is not the
plugin's fault, it will report errors if it gets them from the library\ /
the driver. If a driver complains about an option, the plugin will dump a
complete list of all options understood by that driver to the log. There is no
way to programmatically find out if an option expects a string or a numeric
argument, so you will have to refer to the appropriate \s-1DBD\s0's documentation to
find this out. Sorry.
.IP "\fBSelectDB\fR \fIDatabase\fR" 4
.IX Item "SelectDB Database"
In some cases, the database name you connect with is not the database name you
want to use for querying data. If this option is set, the plugin will \*(L"select\*(R"
(switch to) that database after the connection is established.
.IP "\fBQuery\fR \fIQueryName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Query QueryName"
Associates the query named \fIQueryName\fR with this database connection. The
query needs to be defined \fIbefore\fR this statement, i.\ e. all query
blocks you want to refer to must be placed above the database block you want to
refer to them from.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIHostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Hostname"
Sets the \fBhost\fR field of \fIvalue lists\fR to \fIHostname\fR when dispatching
values. Defaults to the global hostname setting.

.Sp
The memory performance metrics are the following:
  total_bytes_read    Number of bytes transacted by the read operations.
  total_bytes_written Number of bytes transacted by the write operations.
  read_64B_ops_rcvd   Number of read operations performed to the physical media in 64 bytes granularity.

.IX Subsection "Plugin disk"
The \f(CW\*(C`disk\*(C'\fR plugin collects information about the usage of physical disks and

to and read from a disk or partition, the number of read/write operations
issued to the disk and a rather complex \*(L"time\*(R" it took for these commands to be

Using the following two options you can ignore some disks or configure the
collection only of specific disks.
.IP "\fBDisk\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Disk Name"
Select the disk \fIName\fR. Whether it is collected or ignored depends on the
\&\fBIgnoreSelected\fR setting, see below. As with other plugins that use the
daemon's ignorelist functionality, a string that starts and ends with a slash
is interpreted as a regular expression. Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2

(hopefully) is intuitive: If no \fBDisk\fR option is configured, all disks are
collected. If at least one \fBDisk\fR option is given and no \fBIgnoreSelected\fR or

Please note that using an attribute that does not differentiate between the
whole disk and its particular partitions (like \fB\s-1ID_SERIAL\s0\fR) will result in
data about the whole disk and each partition being mixed together incorrectly.

The \f(CW\*(C`filecount\*(C'\fR plugin counts the number of files in a certain directory (and
its subdirectories) and their combined size. The configuration is very straight
forward:
.PP
.Vb 12

.PP
The example above counts the number of files in QMail's queue directories and
the number of \s-1PHP5\s0 sessions. Jfiy: The \*(L"todo\*(R" queue holds the messages that
QMail has not yet looked at, the \*(L"message\*(R" queue holds the messages that were
classified into \*(L"local\*(R" and \*(L"remote\*(R".
.PP
As you can see, the configuration consists of one or more \f(CW\*(C`Directory\*(C'\fR blocks,
each of which specifies a directory in which to count the files. Within those
blocks, the following options are recognized:
.IP "\fBPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "Plugin Plugin"
Use \fIPlugin\fR as the plugin name when submitting values.
Defaults to \fBfilecount\fR.
.IP "\fBInstance\fR \fIInstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "Instance Instance"
Sets the plugin instance to \fIInstance\fR. If not given, the instance is set to
the directory name with all slashes replaced by underscores and all leading
underscores removed. Empty value is allowed.
.IP "\fBName\fR \fIPattern\fR" 4
.IX Item "Name Pattern"
Only count files that match \fIPattern\fR, where \fIPattern\fR is a shell-like
wildcard as understood by \fBfnmatch\fR\|(3). Only the \fBfilename\fR is checked
against the pattern, not the entire path. In case this makes it easier for you:
This option has been named after the \fB\-name\fR parameter to \fBfind\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBMTime\fR \fIAge\fR" 4
.IX Item "MTime Age"
Count only files of a specific age: If \fIAge\fR is greater than zero, only files
that haven't been touched in the last \fIAge\fR seconds are counted. If \fIAge\fR is
a negative number, this is inversed. For example, if \fB\-60\fR is specified, only
files that have been modified in the last minute will be counted.
.Sp
The number can also be followed by a \*(L"multiplier\*(R" to easily specify a larger
timespan. When given in this notation, the argument must in quoted, i.\ e.
must be passed as string. So the \fB\-60\fR could also be written as \fB\*(L"\-1m\*(R"\fR (one
minute). Valid multipliers are \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR (second), \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR (minute), \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR (hour), \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR
(day), \f(CW\*(C`w\*(C'\fR (week), and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR (year). There is no \*(L"month\*(R" multiplier. You can
also specify fractional numbers, e.\ g. \fB\*(L"0.5d\*(R"\fR is identical to
\&\fB\*(L"12h\*(R"\fR.
.IP "\fBSize\fR \fISize\fR" 4
.IX Item "Size Size"
Count only files of a specific size. When \fISize\fR is a positive number, only
files that are at least this big are counted. If \fISize\fR is a negative number,
this is inversed, i.\ e. only files smaller than the absolute value of
\&\fISize\fR are counted.
.Sp
As with the \fBMTime\fR option, a \*(L"multiplier\*(R" may be added. For a detailed
description see above. Valid multipliers here are \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR (byte), \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR (kilobyte),
\&\f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR (megabyte), \f(CW\*(C`g\*(C'\fR (gigabyte), \f(CW\*(C`t\*(C'\fR (terabyte), and \f(CW\*(C`p\*(C'\fR (petabyte). Please
note that there are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte, not 1024.
.IP "\fBRecursive\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Recursive true|false"
Controls whether or not to recurse into subdirectories. Enabled by default.
.IP "\fBIncludeHidden\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IncludeHidden true|false"
Controls whether or not to include \*(L"hidden\*(R" files and directories in the count.
\&\*(L"Hidden\*(R" files and directories are those, whose name begins with a dot.
Defaults to \fIfalse\fR, i.e. by default hidden files and directories are ignored.
.IP "\fBRegularOnly\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "RegularOnly true|false"
Controls whether or not to include only regular files in the count.
Defaults to \fItrue\fR, i.e. by default non regular files are ignored.
.IP "\fBFilesSizeType\fR \fIType\fR" 4
.IX Item "FilesSizeType Type"
Sets the type used to dispatch files combined size. Empty value ("") disables
reporting. Defaults to \fBbytes\fR.
.IP "\fBFilesCountType\fR \fIType\fR" 4

The \fIintel_rdt\fR plugin collects information provided by monitoring features of
Intel Resource Director Technology (Intel(R) \s-1RDT\s0) like Cache Monitoring
Technology (\s-1CMT\s0), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (\s-1MBM\s0). These features provide
information about utilization of shared resources. \s-1CMT\s0 monitors last level cache
occupancy (\s-1LLC\s0). \s-1MBM\s0 supports two types of events reporting local and remote
memory bandwidth. Local memory bandwidth (\s-1MBL\s0) reports the bandwidth of
accessing memory associated with the local socket. Remote memory bandwidth (\s-1MBR\s0)
reports the bandwidth of accessing the remote socket. Also this technology
allows to monitor instructions per clock (\s-1IPC\s0).
Monitor events are hardware dependant. Monitoring capabilities are detected on
plugin initialization and only supported events are monitored.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR \fIintel_rdt\fR plugin is using model-specific registers (MSRs), which

If no configuration is given, the \fBinterface\fR\-plugin will collect data from
all interfaces. This may not be practical, especially for loopback\- and
similar interfaces. Thus, you can use the \fBInterface\fR\-option to pick the
interfaces you're interested in. Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred
to collect all interfaces \fIexcept\fR a few ones. This option enables you to
do that: By setting \fBIgnoreSelected\fR to \fItrue\fR the effect of
\&\fBInterface\fR is inverted: All selected interfaces are ignored and all
other interfaces are collected.
.Sp
It is possible to use regular expressions to match interface names, if the
name is surrounded by \fI/.../\fR and collectd was compiled with support for
regexps. This is useful if there's a need to collect (or ignore) data
for a group of interfaces that are similarly named, without the need to
explicitly list all of them (especially useful if the list is dynamic).
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& Interface "lo"
\& Interface "/^veth/"
\& Interface "/^tun[0\-9]+/"

This will ignore the loopback interface, all interfaces with names starting

package was sent at any time from boot and the corresponding counter
is non-zero. So, if the interface has been sending data in the past
since boot, but not during the reported time-interval, it will still
be reported.

The \fI mdevents \fR plugin collects status changes from md (Linux software \s-1RAID\s0) devices.
.PP
\&\s-1RAID\s0 arrays are meant to allow users/administrators to keep systems up and
running, in case of common hardware problems (disk failure). Mdadm is the
standard software \s-1RAID\s0 management tool for Linux. It provides the ability to 
monitor \*(L"metadata event\*(R" occurring such as disk failures, clean-to-dirty 
transitions, and etc. The kernel provides the ability to report such actions to 
the userspace via sysfs, and mdadm takes action accordingly with the monitoring 
capability. The mdmon polls the /sys looking for changes in the entries 
array_state, sync_action, and per disk state attribute files. This is meaningful
for \s-1RAID1, 5\s0 and 10 only.
.PP
Mdevents plugin is based on gathering \s-1RAID\s0 array events that are
written to syslog by mdadm. After registering an event, it can send a collectd
notification that contains mdadm event's data. Event consists of event type,
raid array name and, for particular events, name of component device.
.PP
Example message:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Jan 17 05:24:27 pc1 mdadm[188]: NewArray event detected on md device /dev/md0\*(C'\fR
.PP
Plugin also classifies gathered event. This means that a notification will have
a different severity {\s-1OKAY, WARNING, FAILURE\s0} for particular mdadm event.

the running system. Otherwise it will not be compiled as a part of collectd.

The netapp plugin accepts the following configuration options:
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host Name"
A host block defines one NetApp filer. It will appear in collectd with the name
you specify here which does not have to be its real name nor its hostname (see
the \fBAddress\fR option below).
.IP "\fBVFiler\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "VFiler Name"
A \fBVFiler\fR block may only be used inside a host block. It accepts all the
same options as the \fBHost\fR block (except for cascaded \fBVFiler\fR blocks) and
will execute all NetApp \s-1API\s0 commands in the context of the specified
VFiler(R). It will appear in collectd with the name you specify here which
does not have to be its real name. The VFiler name may be specified using the
\&\fBVFilerName\fR option. If this is not specified, it will default to the name
you specify here.
.Sp
The VFiler block inherits all connection related settings from the surrounding
\&\fBHost\fR block (which appear before the \fBVFiler\fR block) but they may be
overwritten inside the \fBVFiler\fR block.
.Sp
This feature is useful, for example, when using a VFiler as SnapVault target
(supported since OnTap 8.1). In that case, the SnapVault statistics are not
available in the host filer (vfiler0) but only in the respective VFiler
context.

Select the given volume for \s-1IO,\s0 operations or latency statistics collection.
The argument is the name of the volume without the \f(CW\*(C`/vol/\*(C'\fR prefix.
.Sp
Since the standard ignorelist functionality is used here, you can use a string
starting and ending with a slash to specify regular expression matching: To
match the volumes \*(L"vol0\*(R", \*(L"vol2\*(R" and \*(L"vol7\*(R", you can use this regular
expression:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
If no regular expression is specified, an exact match is required. Both,
regular and exact matching are case sensitive.

.IX Item "Interval Seconds"
Collect volume usage statistics every \fISeconds\fR seconds.
.IP "\fBGetCapacity\fR \fIVolumeName\fR" 4
.IX Item "GetCapacity VolumeName"
The current capacity of the volume will be collected. This will result in two
to four value lists, depending on the configuration of the volume. All data
sources are of type \*(L"df_complex\*(R" with the name of the volume as
plugin_instance.
.Sp
There will be type_instances \*(L"used\*(R" and \*(L"free\*(R" for the number of used and
available bytes on the volume.  If the volume has some space reserved for
snapshots, a type_instance \*(L"snap_reserved\*(R" will be available.  If the volume
has \s-1SIS\s0 enabled, a type_instance \*(L"sis_saved\*(R" will be available. This is the
number of bytes saved by the \s-1SIS\s0 feature.
.Sp
\&\fBNote:\fR The current NetApp \s-1API\s0 has a bug that results in this value being
reported as a 32\ bit number. This plugin tries to guess the correct
number which works most of the time.  If you see strange values here, bug
NetApp support to fix this.
.Sp
Repeat this option to specify multiple volumes.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelectedCapacity\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelectedCapacity true|false"
Specify whether to collect only the volumes selected by the \fBGetCapacity\fR
option or to ignore those volumes. \fBIgnoreSelectedCapacity\fR defaults to
\&\fBfalse\fR. However, if no \fBGetCapacity\fR option is specified at all, all
capacities will be selected anyway.
.IP "\fBGetSnapshot\fR \fIVolumeName\fR" 4
.IX Item "GetSnapshot VolumeName"
Select volumes from which to collect snapshot information.
.Sp
Usually, the space used for snapshots is included in the space reported as
\&\*(L"used\*(R". If snapshot information is collected as well, the space used for
snapshots is subtracted from the used space.
.Sp
To make things even more interesting, it is possible to reserve space to be
used for snapshots. If the space required for snapshots is less than that
reserved space, there is \*(L"reserved free\*(R" and \*(L"reserved used\*(R" space in addition
to \*(L"free\*(R" and \*(L"used\*(R". If the space required for snapshots exceeds the reserved
space, that part allocated in the normal space is subtracted from the \*(L"used\*(R"
space again.
.Sp
Repeat this option to specify multiple volumes.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelectedSnapshot\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelectedSnapshot"
Specify whether to collect only the volumes selected by the \fBGetSnapshot\fR
option or to ignore those volumes. \fBIgnoreSelectedSnapshot\fR defaults to
\&\fBfalse\fR. However, if no \fBGetSnapshot\fR option is specified at all, all
capacities will be selected anyway.
.PP

.IX Item "Interface Interface"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBVerboseInterface\fR \fIInterface\fR" 4
.IX Item "VerboseInterface Interface"
.PD
Instruct the plugin to collect interface statistics. This is basically the same
as the statistics provided by the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin (see above) but
potentially much more detailed.
.Sp
When configuring with \fBInterface\fR only the basic statistics will be collected,
namely octets, packets, and errors. These statistics are collected by
the \f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin, too, so using both at the same time is no benefit.
.Sp
When configured with \fBVerboseInterface\fR all counters \fBexcept\fR the basic ones
will be collected, so that no data needs to be collected twice if you use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`interface\*(C'\fR plugin.
This includes dropped packets, received multicast packets, collisions and a
whole zoo of differentiated \s-1RX\s0 and \s-1TX\s0 errors. You can try the following command
to get an idea of what awaits you:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  ip \-s \-s link list
.Ve
.Sp
If \fIInterface\fR is \fBAll\fR, all interfaces will be selected.
.Sp
It is possible to use regular expressions to match interface names, if the
name is surrounded by \fI/.../\fR and collectd was compiled with support for
regexps. This is useful if there's a need to collect (or ignore) data
for a group of interfaces that are similarly named, without the need to
explicitly list all of them (especially useful if the list is dynamic).
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& Interface "/^eth/"
\& Interface "/^ens[1\-4]$|^enp[0\-3]$/"
\& VerboseInterface "/^eno[0\-9]+/"
.Ve
.Sp
This will match all interfaces with names starting with \fIeth\fR, all interfaces
in range \fIens1 \- ens4\fR and \fIenp0 \- enp3\fR, and for verbose metrics all
interfaces with names starting with \fIeno\fR followed by at least one digit.

.IX Item "Filter Interface [Filter]"
.PD
Collect the octets and packets that pass a certain qdisc, class or filter.
.Sp
QDiscs and classes are identified by their type and handle (or classid).
Filters don't necessarily have a handle, therefore the parent's handle is used.
The notation used in collectd differs from that used in \fBtc\fR\|(1) in that it
doesn't skip the major or minor number if it's zero and doesn't print special
ids by their name. So, for example, a qdisc may be identified by
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfifo_fast\-1:0\*(C'\fR even though the minor number of \fBall\fR qdiscs is zero and
thus not displayed by \fBtc\fR\|(1).
.Sp
If \fBQDisc\fR, \fBClass\fR, or \fBFilter\fR is given without the second argument,
i.\ .e. without an identifier, all qdiscs, classes, or filters that are
associated with that interface will be collected.
.Sp
Since a filter itself doesn't necessarily have a handle, the parent's handle is
used. This may lead to problems when more than one filter is attached to a
qdisc or class. This isn't nice, but we don't know how this could be done any
better. If you have a idea, please don't hesitate to tell us.
.Sp
As with the \fBInterface\fR option you can specify \fBAll\fR as the interface,
meaning all interfaces.

Here are some examples to help you understand the above text more easily:

.IP "\fBInterface\fR \fIInterface name\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interface Interface name"
Set the outgoing interface for \s-1IP\s0 packets. This applies at least
to IPv6 packets and if possible to IPv4. If this option is not applicable,
undefined or a non-existent interface name is specified, the default
behavior is to let the kernel choose the appropriate interface. Be warned

.IX Item "ResolveInterval Seconds"
Sets the interval at which to re-resolve the \s-1DNS\s0 for the \fIHost\fR. This is

.Sp
The argument \fIHost\fR may be a hostname, an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address. If
the argument is a multicast address the daemon will join that multicast group.

of encrypted packets is ensured using \fI\s-1SHA\-1\s0\fR. When set to \fBSign\fR, only
signed and encrypted data is accepted. When set to \fBNone\fR, all data will be
accepted. If an \fBAuthFile\fR option was given (see below), encrypted data is
decrypted if possible.
.Sp
This feature is only available if the \fInetwork\fR plugin was linked with
\&\fIlibgcrypt\fR.
.IP "\fBAuthFile\fR \fIFilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "AuthFile Filename"
Sets a file in which usernames are mapped to passwords. These passwords are
used to verify signatures and to decrypt encrypted network packets. If
\&\fBSecurityLevel\fR is set to \fBNone\fR, this is optional. If given, signed data is
verified and encrypted packets are decrypted. Otherwise, signed data is
accepted without checking the signature and encrypted data cannot be decrypted.
For the other security levels this option is mandatory.
.Sp
The file format is very simple: Each line consists of a username followed by a
colon and any number of spaces followed by the password. To demonstrate, an
example file could look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  user0: foo
\&  user1: bar
.Ve
.Sp
Each time a packet is received, the modification time of the file is checked
using \fBstat\fR\|(2). If the file has been changed, the contents is re-read. While
the file is being read, it is locked using \fBfcntl\fR\|(2).
.IP "\fBInterface\fR \fIInterface name\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interface Interface name"
Set the incoming interface for \s-1IP\s0 packets explicitly. This applies at least
to IPv6 packets and if possible to IPv4. If this option is not applicable,
undefined or a non-existent interface name is specified, the default
behavior is, to let the kernel choose the appropriate interface. Thus incoming
traffic gets only accepted, if it arrives on the given interface.

.Sp
On the server side, this limit should be set to the largest value used on
\&\fIany\fR client. Likewise, the value on the client must not be larger than the
value on the server, or data will be lost.
.Sp
\&\fBCompatibility:\fR Versions prior to \fIversion\ 4.8\fR used a fixed sized

.IX Item "Forward true|false"
If set to \fItrue\fR, write packets that were received via the network plugin to
the sending sockets. This should only be activated when the \fBListen\fR\- and
\&\fBServer\fR\-statements differ. Otherwise packets may be send multiple times to
the same multicast group. While this results in more network traffic than
necessary it's not a huge problem since the plugin has a duplicate detection,
so the values will not loop.

.IX Item "ReportStats true|false"
The network plugin cannot only receive and send statistics, it can also create
statistics about itself. Collectd data included the number of received and

The \f(CW\*(C`onewire\*(C'\fR plugin uses the \fBowcapi\fR library from the \fBowfs\fR project
<http://owfs.org/> to read sensors connected via the onewire bus.
.PP
It can be used in two possible modes \- standard or advanced.
.PP
In the standard mode only temperature sensors (sensors with the family code
\&\f(CW10\fR, \f(CW22\fR and \f(CW28\fR \- e.g. \s-1DS1820, DS18S20, DS1920\s0) can be read. If you have
other sensors you would like to have included, please send a sort request to
the mailing list. You can select sensors to be read or to be ignored depending
on the option \fBIgnoreSelected\fR). When no list is provided the whole bus is
walked and all sensors are read.
.PP
Hubs (the \s-1DS2409\s0 chips) are working, but read the note, why this plugin is
experimental, below.
.PP
In the advanced mode you can configure any sensor to be read (only numerical
value) using full \s-1OWFS\s0 path (e.g. \*(L"/uncached/10.F10FCA000800/temperature\*(R").
In this mode you have to list all the sensors. Neither default bus walk nor
\&\fBIgnoreSelected\fR are used here. Address and type (file) is extracted from
the path automatically and should produce compatible structure with the \*(L"standard\*(R"
mode (basically the path is expected as for example
\&\*(L"/uncached/10.F10FCA000800/temperature\*(R" where it would extract address part
\&\*(L"F10FCA000800\*(R" and the rest after the slash is considered the type \- here
\&\*(L"temperature\*(R").
There are two advantages to this mode \- you can access virtually any sensor
(not just temperature), select whether to use cached or directly read values
and it is slighlty faster. The downside is more complex configuration.
.PP
The two modes are distinguished automatically by the format of the address.
It is not possible to mix the two modes. Once a full path is detected in any
\&\fBSensor\fR then the whole addressing (all sensors) is considered to be this way
(and as standard addresses will fail parsing they will be ignored).

Though the documentation claims to automatically recognize the given address

the family byte at the beginning, so you have to use for example \f(CW\*(C`F10FCA000800\*(C'\fR,
and \fBnot\fR include the leading \f(CW10.\fR family byte and point.
When no \fBSensor\fR is configured the whole Onewire bus is walked and all supported
sensors (see above) are read.

\&\f(CW\*(C`/10.F10FCA000800/temperature\*(C'\fR). \fBIgnoreSelected\fR is not used.

If no configuration is given, the \fBonewire\fR plugin will collect data from all

\&\fB\s-1EXPERIMENTAL\s0!\fR The \f(CW\*(C`onewire\*(C'\fR plugin is experimental, because it doesn't yet
work with big setups. It works with one sensor being attached to one

interval). We will probably add some separate thread for reading the sensors

server correctly. The backend database \f(CW\*(C`monitor\*(C'\fR needs to be loaded and
working. See \fBslapd\-monitor\fR\|(5) for the details.
.PP
The configuration of the \f(CW\*(C`openldap\*(C'\fR plugin consists of one or more \fBInstance\fR
blocks. Each block requires one string argument as the instance name. For
example:
.PP
.Vb 8
\& <Plugin "openldap">
\&   <Instance "foo">
\&     URL "ldap://localhost/"
\&   </Instance>
\&   <Instance "bar">
\&     URL "ldaps://localhost/"
\&   </Instance>
\& </Plugin>
.Ve
.PP
The instance name will be used as the \fIplugin instance\fR. To emulate the old
(version\ 4) behavior, you can use an empty string (""). In order for the
plugin to work correctly, each instance name must be unique. This is not
enforced by the plugin and it is your responsibility to ensure it is.
.PP
The following options are accepted within each \fBInstance\fR block:
.IP "\fB\s-1URL\s0\fR \fIldap://host/binddn\fR" 4
.IX Item "URL ldap://host/binddn"
Sets the \s-1URL\s0 to use to connect to the \fIOpenLDAP\fR server. This option is
\&\fImandatory\fR.
.IP "\fBBindDN\fR \fIBindDN\fR" 4
.IX Item "BindDN BindDN"
Name in the form of an \s-1LDAP\s0 distinguished name intended to be used for
authentication. Defaults to empty string to establish an anonymous authorization.
.IP "\fBPassword\fR \fIPassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "Password Password"
Password for simple bind authentication. If this option is not set,
unauthenticated bind operation is used.
.IP "\fBStartTLS\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "StartTLS true|false"
Defines whether \s-1TLS\s0 must be used when connecting to the \fIOpenLDAP\fR server.
Disabled by default.
.IP "\fBVerifyHost\fR \fBtrue|false\fR" 4
.IX Item "VerifyHost true|false"
Enables or disables peer host name verification. If enabled, the plugin checks
if the \f(CW\*(C`Common Name\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`Subject Alternate Name\*(C'\fR field of the \s-1SSL\s0
certificate matches the host name provided by the \fB\s-1URL\s0\fR option. If this
identity check fails, the connection is aborted. Enabled by default.
.IP "\fBCACert\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "CACert File"
File that holds one or more \s-1SSL\s0 certificates. If you want to use \s-1TLS/SSL\s0 you
may possibly need this option. What \s-1CA\s0 certificates are checked by default
depends on the distribution you use and can be changed with the usual ldap
client configuration mechanisms. See \fBldap.conf\fR\|(5) for the details.
.IP "\fBTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Timeout Seconds"
Sets the timeout value for ldap operations, in seconds. By default, the
configured \fBInterval\fR is used to set the timeout. Use \fB\-1\fR to disable
(infinite timeout).
.IP "\fBVersion\fR \fIVersion\fR" 4
.IX Item "Version Version"
An integer which sets the \s-1LDAP\s0 protocol version number to use when connecting
to the \fIOpenLDAP\fR server. Defaults to \fB3\fR for using \fILDAPv3\fR.
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""openvpn"""
.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWopenvpn\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin openvpn"
The OpenVPN plugin reads a status file maintained by OpenVPN and gathers
traffic statistics about connected clients.
.PP
To set up OpenVPN to write to the status file periodically, use the
\&\fB\-\-status\fR option of OpenVPN.
.PP
So, in a nutshell you need:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  openvpn $OTHER_OPTIONS \e
\&    \-\-status "/var/run/openvpn\-status" 10
.Ve
.PP
Available options:
.IP "\fBStatusFile\fR \fIFile\fR" 4
.IX Item "StatusFile File"
Specifies the location of the status file.
.IP "\fBImprovedNamingSchema\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "ImprovedNamingSchema true|false"
When enabled, the filename of the status file will be used as plugin instance
and the client's \*(L"common name\*(R" will be used as type instance. This is required
when reading multiple status files. Enabling this option is recommended, but to
maintain backwards compatibility this option is disabled by default.
.IP "\fBCollectCompression\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "CollectCompression true|false"
Sets whether or not statistics about the compression used by OpenVPN should be
collected. This information is only available in \fIsingle\fR mode. Enabled by
default.
.IP "\fBCollectIndividualUsers\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "CollectIndividualUsers true|false"
Sets whether or not traffic information is collected for each connected client
individually. If set to false, currently no traffic data is collected at all
because aggregating this data in a save manner is tricky. Defaults to \fBtrue\fR.
.IP "\fBCollectUserCount\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "CollectUserCount true|false"
When enabled, the number of currently connected clients or users is collected.
This is especially interesting when \fBCollectIndividualUsers\fR is disabled, but
can be configured independently from that option. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.

.IX Subsection "Plugin postgresql"
The \f(CW\*(C`postgresql\*(C'\fR plugin queries statistics from PostgreSQL databases. It
keeps a persistent connection to all configured databases and tries to
reconnect if the connection has been interrupted. A database is configured by
specifying a \fBDatabase\fR block as described below. The default statistics are
collected from PostgreSQL's \fBstatistics collector\fR which thus has to be
enabled for this plugin to work correctly. This should usually be the case by
default. See the section \*(L"The Statistics Collector\*(R" of the \fBPostgreSQL
Documentation\fR for details.
.PP
By specifying custom database queries using a \fBQuery\fR block as described
below, you may collect any data that is available from some PostgreSQL
database. This way, you are able to access statistics of external daemons
which are available in a PostgreSQL database or use future or special
statistics provided by PostgreSQL without the need to upgrade your collectd
installation.
.PP
Starting with version 5.2, the \f(CW\*(C`postgresql\*(C'\fR plugin supports writing data to
PostgreSQL databases as well. This has been implemented in a generic way. You
need to specify an \s-1SQL\s0 statement which will then be executed by collectd in
order to write the data (see below for details). The benefit of that approach
is that there is no fixed database layout. Rather, the layout may be optimized
for the current setup.

The \fBQuery\fR block defines one database query which may later be used by a
database definition. It accepts a single mandatory argument which specifies
the name of the query. The names of all queries have to be unique (see the
\&\fBMinVersion\fR and \fBMaxVersion\fR options below for an exception to this
rule).
.PP
In each \fBQuery\fR block, there is one or more \fBResult\fR blocks. Multiple
\&\fBResult\fR blocks may be used to extract multiple values from a single query.
.PP
The following configuration options are available to define the query:
.IP "\fBStatement\fR \fIsql query statement\fR" 4
.IX Item "Statement sql query statement"
Specify the \fIsql query statement\fR which the plugin should execute. The string
may contain the tokens \fB\f(CB$1\fB\fR, \fB\f(CB$2\fB\fR, etc. which are used to reference the
first, second, etc. parameter. The value of the parameters is specified by the
\&\fBParam\fR configuration option \- see below for details. To include a literal
\&\fB$\fR character followed by a number, surround it with single quotes (\fB'\fR).
.Sp
Any \s-1SQL\s0 command which may return data (such as \f(CW\*(C`SELECT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SHOW\*(C'\fR) is
allowed. Note, however, that only a single command may be used. Semicolons are
allowed as long as a single non-empty command has been specified only.
.Sp
The returned lines will be handled separately one after another.
.IP "\fBParam\fR \fIhostname\fR|\fIdatabase\fR|\fIinstance\fR|\fIusername\fR|\fIinterval\fR" 4
.IX Item "Param hostname|database|instance|username|interval"
Specify the parameters which should be passed to the \s-1SQL\s0 query. The parameters
are referred to in the \s-1SQL\s0 query as \fB\f(CB$1\fB\fR, \fB\f(CB$2\fB\fR, etc. in the same order as
they appear in the configuration file. The value of the parameter is
determined depending on the value of the \fBParam\fR option as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "\fIhostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "hostname"
The configured hostname of the database connection. If a \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket is
used, the parameter expands to \*(L"localhost\*(R".
.IP "\fIdatabase\fR" 4
.IX Item "database"
The name of the database of the current connection.
.IP "\fIinstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "instance"
The name of the database plugin instance. See the \fBInstance\fR option of the
database specification below for details.
.IP "\fIusername\fR" 4
.IX Item "username"
The username used to connect to the database.
.IP "\fIinterval\fR" 4
.IX Item "interval"
The interval with which this database is queried (as specified by the database
specific or global \fBInterval\fR options).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Please note that parameters are only supported by PostgreSQL's protocol
version 3 and above which was introduced in version 7.4 of PostgreSQL.
.RE
.IP "\fBPluginInstanceFrom\fR \fIcolumn\fR" 4
.IX Item "PluginInstanceFrom column"
Specify how to create the \*(L"PluginInstance\*(R" for reporting this query results.
Only one column is supported. You may concatenate fields and string values in
the query statement to get the required results.
.IP "\fBMinVersion\fR \fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "MinVersion version"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBMaxVersion\fR \fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "MaxVersion version"
.PD
Specify the minimum or maximum version of PostgreSQL that this query should be
used with. Some statistics might only be available with certain versions of
PostgreSQL. This allows you to specify multiple queries with the same name but
which apply to different versions, thus allowing you to use the same
configuration in a heterogeneous environment.
.Sp
The \fIversion\fR has to be specified as the concatenation of the major, minor
and patch-level versions, each represented as two-decimal-digit numbers. For
example, version 8.2.3 will become 80203.
.PP
The \fBResult\fR block defines how to handle the values returned from the query.
It defines which column holds which value and how to dispatch that value to
the daemon.
.IP "\fBType\fR \fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "Type type"
The \fItype\fR name to be used when dispatching the values. The type describes
how to handle the data and where to store it. See \fBtypes.db\fR\|(5) for more
details on types and their configuration. The number and type of values (as
selected by the \fBValuesFrom\fR option) has to match the type of the given name.
.Sp
This option is mandatory.
.IP "\fBInstancePrefix\fR \fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "InstancePrefix prefix"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBInstancesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "InstancesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
.PD
Specify how to create the \*(L"TypeInstance\*(R" for each data set (i.\ e. line).
\&\fBInstancePrefix\fR defines a static prefix that will be prepended to all type
instances. \fBInstancesFrom\fR defines the column names whose values will be used
to create the type instance. Multiple values will be joined together using the
hyphen (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR) as separation character.
.Sp
The plugin itself does not check whether or not all built instances are
different. It is your responsibility to assure that each is unique.
.Sp
Both options are optional. If none is specified, the type instance will be
empty.
.IP "\fBValuesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "ValuesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
Names the columns whose content is used as the actual data for the data sets
that are dispatched to the daemon. How many such columns you need is
determined by the \fBType\fR setting as explained above. If you specify too many
or not enough columns, the plugin will complain about that and no data will be
submitted to the daemon.
.Sp
The actual data type, as seen by PostgreSQL, is not that important as long as
it represents numbers. The plugin will automatically cast the values to the
right type if it know how to do that. For that, it uses the \fBstrtoll\fR\|(3) and
\&\fBstrtod\fR\|(3) functions, so anything supported by those functions is supported
by the plugin as well.
.Sp
This option is required inside a \fBResult\fR block and may be specified multiple
times. If multiple \fBValuesFrom\fR options are specified, the columns are read
in the given order.
.PP
The following predefined queries are available (the definitions can be found
in the \fIpostgresql_default.conf\fR file which, by default, is available at
\&\f(CW\*(C`\f(CIprefix\f(CW/share/collectd/\*(C'\fR):
.IP "\fBbackends\fR" 4
.IX Item "backends"
This query collects the number of backends, i.\ e. the number of
connected clients.
.IP "\fBtransactions\fR" 4
.IX Item "transactions"
This query collects the numbers of committed and rolled-back transactions of
the user tables.
.IP "\fBqueries\fR" 4
.IX Item "queries"
This query collects the numbers of various table modifications (i.\ e.
insertions, updates, deletions) of the user tables.
.IP "\fBquery_plans\fR" 4
.IX Item "query_plans"
This query collects the numbers of various table scans and returned tuples of
the user tables.
.IP "\fBtable_states\fR" 4
.IX Item "table_states"
This query collects the numbers of live and dead rows in the user tables.
.IP "\fBdisk_io\fR" 4

.IP "\fBdisk_usage\fR" 4
.IX Item "disk_usage"
This query collects the on-disk size of the database in bytes.
.PP
In addition, the following detailed queries are available by default. Please
note that each of those queries collects information \fBby table\fR, thus,
potentially producing \fBa lot\fR of data. For details see the description of the
non\-by_table queries above.

The \fBWriter\fR block defines a PostgreSQL writer backend. It accepts a single
mandatory argument specifying the name of the writer. This will then be used
in the \fBDatabase\fR specification in order to activate the writer instance. The
names of all writers have to be unique. The following options may be
specified:
.IP "\fBStatement\fR \fIsql statement\fR" 4
.IX Item "Statement sql statement"
This mandatory option specifies the \s-1SQL\s0 statement that will be executed for
each submitted value. A single \s-1SQL\s0 statement is allowed only. Anything after
the first semicolon will be ignored.
.Sp
Nine parameters will be passed to the statement and should be specified as
tokens \fB\f(CB$1\fB\fR, \fB\f(CB$2\fB\fR, through \fB\f(CB$9\fB\fR in the statement string. The following
values are made available through those parameters:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\f(CB$1\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$1"
The timestamp of the queried value as an \s-1RFC\s0 3339\-formatted local time.
.IP "\fB\f(CB$2\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$2"
The hostname of the queried value.
.IP "\fB\f(CB$3\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$3"
The plugin name of the queried value.
.IP "\fB\f(CB$4\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$4"
The plugin instance of the queried value. This value may be \fB\s-1NULL\s0\fR if there
is no plugin instance.
.IP "\fB\f(CB$5\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$5"
The type of the queried value (cf. \fBtypes.db\fR\|(5)).
.IP "\fB\f(CB$6\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$6"
The type instance of the queried value. This value may be \fB\s-1NULL\s0\fR if there is
no type instance.
.IP "\fB\f(CB$7\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$7"
An array of names for the submitted values (i.\ e., the name of the data
sources of the submitted value-list).
.IP "\fB\f(CB$8\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "$8"
An array of types for the submitted values (i.\ e., the type of the data
sources of the submitted value-list; \f(CW\*(C`counter\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`gauge\*(C'\fR, ...). Note, that if
\&\fBStoreRates\fR is enabled (which is the default, see below), all types will be

In general, it is advisable to create and call a custom function in the

.PP
The \fBDatabase\fR block defines one PostgreSQL database for which to collect
statistics. It accepts a single mandatory argument which specifies the
database name. None of the other options are required. PostgreSQL will use
default values as documented in the section \*(L"\s-1CONNECTING TO A DATABASE\*(R"\s0 in the
\&\fBpsql\fR\|(1) manpage. However, be aware that those defaults may be influenced by
the user collectd is run as and special environment variables. See the manpage
for details.
.IP "\fBInterval\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Interval seconds"
Specify the interval with which the database should be queried. The default is
to use the global \fBInterval\fR setting.
.IP "\fBCommitInterval\fR \fIseconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "CommitInterval seconds"
This option may be used for database connections which have \*(L"writers\*(R" assigned
(see above). If specified, it causes a writer to put several updates into a
single transaction. This transaction will last for the specified amount of
time. By default, each update will be executed in a separate transaction. Each
transaction generates a fair amount of overhead which can, thus, be reduced by
activating this option. The draw-back is, that data covering the specified
amount of time will be lost, for example, if a single statement within the
transaction fails or if the database server crashes.
.IP "\fBPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "Plugin Plugin"
Use \fIPlugin\fR as the plugin name when submitting query results from
this \fBDatabase\fR. Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`postgresql\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBInstance\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "Instance name"
Specify the plugin instance name that should be used instead of the database
name (which is the default, if this option has not been specified). This
allows one to query multiple databases of the same name on the same host (e.g.
when running multiple database server versions in parallel).
The plugin instance name can also be set from the query result using
the \fBPluginInstanceFrom\fR option in \fBQuery\fR block.
.IP "\fBHost\fR \fIhostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "Host hostname"
Specify the hostname or \s-1IP\s0 of the PostgreSQL server to connect to. If the
value begins with a slash, it is interpreted as the directory name in which to
look for the \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket.
.Sp
This option is also used to determine the hostname that is associated with a
collected data set. If it has been omitted or either begins with with a slash
or equals \fBlocalhost\fR it will be replaced with the global hostname definition
of collectd. Any other value will be passed literally to collectd when
dispatching values. Also see the global \fBHostname\fR and \fBFQDNLookup\fR options.
.IP "\fBPort\fR \fIport\fR" 4
.IX Item "Port port"
Specify the \s-1TCP\s0 port or the local \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket file extension of the
server.
.IP "\fBUser\fR \fIusername\fR" 4
.IX Item "User username"
Specify the username to be used when connecting to the server.
.IP "\fBPassword\fR \fIpassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "Password password"
Specify the password to be used when connecting to the server.
.IP "\fBExpireDelay\fR \fIdelay\fR" 4
.IX Item "ExpireDelay delay"
Skip expired values in query output.
.IP "\fBSSLMode\fR \fIdisable\fR|\fIallow\fR|\fIprefer\fR|\fIrequire\fR" 4
.IX Item "SSLMode disable|allow|prefer|require"
Specify whether to use an \s-1SSL\s0 connection when contacting the server. The
following modes are supported:
.RS 4
.IP "\fIdisable\fR" 4
.IX Item "disable"
Do not use \s-1SSL\s0 at all.

The method of getting the values differs for \fBServer\fR and \fBRecursor\fR blocks:
When querying the server a \f(CW\*(C`SHOW *\*(C'\fR command is issued in any case, because
that's the only way of getting multiple values out of the server at once.
collectd then picks out the values you have selected. When querying the
recursor, a command is generated to query exactly these values. So if you
specify invalid fields when querying the recursor, a syntax error may be
returned by the daemon and collectd may not collect any values at all.

.el .SS "Plugin \f(CWrrdcached\fP"
.IX Subsection "Plugin rrdcached"
The \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR plugin uses the RRDtool accelerator daemon, \fBrrdcached\fR\|(1),
to store values to \s-1RRD\s0 files in an efficient manner. The combination of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR \fBplugin\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR \fBdaemon\fR is very similar to the
way the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR plugin works (see below). The added abstraction layer
provides a number of benefits, though: Because the cache is not within
\&\f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR anymore, it does not need to be flushed when \f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR is to be
restarted. This results in much shorter (if any) gaps in graphs, especially
under heavy load. Also, the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR command line utility is aware of the
daemon so that it can flush values to disk automatically when needed. This
allows one to integrate automated flushing of values into graphing solutions
much more easily.
.PP
There are disadvantages, though: The daemon may reside on a different host, so
it may not be possible for \f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR to create the appropriate \s-1RRD\s0 files
anymore. And even if \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR runs on the same host, it may run in a
different base directory, so relative paths may do weird stuff if you're not
careful.
.PP
So the \fBrecommended configuration\fR is to let \f(CW\*(C`collectd\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`rrdcached\*(C'\fR run
on the same host, communicating via a \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket. The \fBDataDir\fR
setting should be set to an absolute path, so that a changed base directory
does not result in \s-1RRD\s0 files being created\ / expected in the wrong place.

might be a good value, though setting this to 7200 seconds doesn't normally
do much harm either.
.Sp
Defaults to 10x \fBCacheTimeout\fR.
\&\fBCacheFlush\fR must be larger than or equal to \fBCacheTimeout\fR, otherwise the
above default is used.
.IP "\fBCacheTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "CacheTimeout Seconds"
If this option is set to a value greater than zero, the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool plugin\*(C'\fR will
save values in a cache, as described above. Writing multiple values at once
reduces IO-operations and thus lessens the load produced by updating the files.
The trade off is that the graphs kind of \*(L"drag behind\*(R" and that more memory is
used.
.IP "\fBWritesPerSecond\fR \fIUpdates\fR" 4
.IX Item "WritesPerSecond Updates"
When collecting many statistics with collectd and the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR plugin, you
will run serious performance problems. The \fBCacheFlush\fR setting and the
internal update queue assert that collectd continues to work just fine even
under heavy load, but the system may become very unresponsive and slow. This is
a problem especially if you create graphs from the \s-1RRD\s0 files on the same
machine, for example using the \f(CW\*(C`graph.cgi\*(C'\fR script included in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`contrib/collection3/\*(C'\fR directory.
.Sp
This setting is designed for very large setups. Setting this option to a value
between 25 and 80 updates per second, depending on your hardware, will leave
the server responsive enough to draw graphs even while all the cached values
are written to disk. Flushed values, i.\ e. values that are forced to disk
by the \fB\s-1FLUSH\s0\fR command, are \fBnot\fR effected by this limit. They are still
written as fast as possible, so that web frontends have up to date data when
generating graphs.
.Sp
For example: If you have 100,000 \s-1RRD\s0 files and set \fBWritesPerSecond\fR to 30
updates per second, writing all values to disk will take approximately
56\ minutes. Together with the flushing ability that's integrated into
\&\*(L"collection3\*(R" you'll end up with a responsive and fast system, up to date
graphs and basically a \*(L"backup\*(R" of your values every hour.
.IP "\fBRandomTimeout\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "RandomTimeout Seconds"
When set, the actual timeout for each value is chosen randomly between
\&\fICacheTimeout\fR\-\fIRandomTimeout\fR and \fICacheTimeout\fR+\fIRandomTimeout\fR. The
intention is to avoid high load situations that appear when many values timeout
at the same time. This is especially a problem shortly after the daemon starts,
because all values were added to the internal cache at roughly the same time.
.ie n .SS "Plugin ""sensors"""

The \fISensors plugin\fR uses \fBlm_sensors\fR to retrieve sensor-values. This means

.IX Item "Sensor chip-bus-address/type-feature"
Selects the name of the sensor which you want to collect or ignore, depending
on the \fBIgnoreSelected\fR below. For example, the option "\fBSensor\fR

voltage sensor \fIin1\fR of the \fIit8712\fR on the isa bus at the address 0290.

.IP "\fBIgnoreSelected\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
If no configuration if given, the \fBsensors\fR\-plugin will collect data from all
sensors. This may not be practical, especially for uninteresting sensors.
Thus, you can use the \fBSensor\fR\-option to pick the sensors you're interested
in. Sometimes, however, it's easier/preferred to collect all sensors \fIexcept\fR a
few ones. This option enables you to do that: By setting \fBIgnoreSelected\fR to
\&\fItrue\fR the effect of \fBSensor\fR is inverted: All selected sensors are ignored
and all other sensors are collected.
.IP "\fBUseLabels\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4

Configures how sensor readings are reported. When set to \fItrue\fR, sensor

Select the disk \fIName\fR. Whether it is collected or ignored depends on the

See \fI/\*(L"\s-1IGNORELISTS\*(R"\s0\fR for details.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSelected\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSelected true|false"
Sets whether selected disks, i.\ e. the ones matches by any of the \fBDisk\fR
statements, are ignored or if all other disks are ignored. The behavior
(hopefully) is intuitive: If no \fBDisk\fR option is configured, all disks are
collected. If at least one \fBDisk\fR option is given and no \fBIgnoreSelected\fR or
set to \fBfalse\fR, \fBonly\fR matching disks will be collected. If \fBIgnoreSelected\fR
is set to \fBtrue\fR, all disks are collected \fBexcept\fR the ones matched.
.IP "\fBIgnoreSleepMode\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "IgnoreSleepMode true|false"
Normally, the \f(CW\*(C`smart\*(C'\fR plugin will ignore disks that are reported to be asleep.
This option disables the sleep mode check and allows the plugin to collect data
from these disks anyway. This is useful in cases where libatasmart mistakenly
reports disks as asleep because it has not been updated to incorporate support
for newer idle states in the \s-1ATA\s0 spec.
.IP "\fBUseSerial\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "UseSerial true|false"
A disk's kernel name (e.g., sda) can change from one boot to the next. If this
option is enabled, the \f(CW\*(C`smart\*(C'\fR plugin will use the disk's serial number (e.g.,
\&\s-1HGST_HUH728080ALE600_2EJ8VH8X\s0) instead of the kernel name as the key for
storing data. This ensures that the data for a given disk will be kept together
even if the kernel name changes.

The configuration consists of one or more \fBTable\fR blocks, each of which
configures one file to parse. Within each \fBTable\fR block, there are one or
more \fBResult\fR blocks, which configure which data to select and how to
interpret it.
.PP
The following options are available inside a \fBTable\fR block:
.IP "\fBPlugin\fR \fIPlugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "Plugin Plugin"
If specified, \fIPlugin\fR is used as the plugin name when submitting values.
Defaults to \fBtable\fR.
.IP "\fBInstance\fR \fIinstance\fR" 4
.IX Item "Instance instance"
If specified, \fIinstance\fR is used as the plugin instance. If omitted, the
filename of the table is used instead, with all special characters replaced
with an underscore (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\fBSeparator\fR \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "Separator string"
Any character of \fIstring\fR is interpreted as a delimiter between the different
columns of the table. A sequence of two or more contiguous delimiters in the
table is considered to be a single delimiter, i.\ e. there cannot be any
empty columns. The plugin uses the \fBstrtok_r\fR\|(3) function to parse the lines
of a table \- see its documentation for more details. This option is mandatory.
.Sp
A horizontal tab, newline and carriage return may be specified by \f(CW\*(C`\e\et\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e\en\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e\er\*(C'\fR respectively. Please note that the double backslashes are
required because of collectd's config parsing.
.PP
The following options are available inside a \fBResult\fR block:
.IP "\fBType\fR \fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "Type type"
Sets the type used to dispatch the values to the daemon. Detailed information
about types and their configuration can be found in \fBtypes.db\fR\|(5). This
option is mandatory.
.IP "\fBInstancePrefix\fR \fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "InstancePrefix prefix"
If specified, prepend \fIprefix\fR to the type instance. If omitted, only the
\&\fBInstancesFrom\fR option is considered for the type instance.
.IP "\fBInstancesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "InstancesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
If specified, the content of the given columns (identified by the column
number starting at zero) will be used to create the type instance for each
row. Multiple values (and the instance prefix) will be joined together with
dashes (\fI\-\fR) as separation character. If omitted, only the \fBInstancePrefix\fR
option is considered for the type instance.
.Sp
The plugin itself does not check whether or not all built instances are
different. ItXs your responsibility to assure that each is unique. This is
especially true, if you do not specify \fBInstancesFrom\fR: \fBYou\fR have to make
sure that the table only contains one row.
.Sp
If neither \fBInstancePrefix\fR nor \fBInstancesFrom\fR is given, the type instance
will be empty.
.IP "\fBValuesFrom\fR \fIcolumn0\fR [\fIcolumn1\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "ValuesFrom column0 [column1 ...]"
Specifies the columns (identified by the column numbers starting at zero)
whose content is used as the actual data for the data sets that are dispatched
to the daemon. How many such columns you need is determined by the \fBType\fR
setting above. If you specify too many or not enough columns, the plugin will
complain about that and no data will be submitted to the daemon. The plugin
uses \fBstrtoll\fR\|(3) and \fBstrtod\fR\|(3) to parse counter and gauge values
respectively, so anything supported by those functions is supported by the
plugin as well. This option is mandatory.

The config consists of one or more \fBFile\fR blocks, each of which configures one
logfile to parse. Within each \fBFile\fR block, there are one or more \fBMatch\fR
blocks, which configure a regular expression to search for.
.PP
The \fBPlugin\fR and \fBInstance\fR options in the \fBFile\fR block may be used to set
the plugin name and instance respectively. So in the above example the plugin name

.PP
These options are applied for all \fBMatch\fR blocks that \fBfollow\fR it, until the

Each \fBMatch\fR block has the following options to describe how the match should
be performed:
.IP "\fBRegex\fR \fIregex\fR" 4
.IX Item "Regex regex"
Sets the regular expression to use for matching against a line. The first
subexpression has to match something that can be turned into a number by
\&\fBstrtoll\fR\|(3) or \fBstrtod\fR\|(3), depending on the value of \f(CW\*(C`CounterAdd\*(C'\fR, see
below. Because \fBextended\fR regular expressions are used, you do not need to use
backslashes for subexpressions! If in doubt, please consult \fBregex\fR\|(7). Due to
collectd's config parsing you need to escape backslashes, though. So if you
want to match literal parentheses you need to do the following:

The \f(CW\*(C`tcpconns plugin\*(C'\fR counts the number of currently established \s-1TCP\s0
connections based on the local port and/or the remote port. Since there may be
a lot of connections the default if to count all connections with a local port,
for which a listening socket is opened. You can use the following options to
fine-tune the ports you are interested in:
.IP "\fBListeningPorts\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "ListeningPorts true|false"
If this option is set to \fItrue\fR, statistics for all local ports for which a
listening socket exists are collected. The default depends on \fBLocalPort\fR and
\&\fBRemotePort\fR (see below): If no port at all is specifically selected, the
default is to collect listening ports. If specific ports (no matter if local or
remote ports) are selected, this option defaults to \fIfalse\fR, i.\ e. only
the selected ports will be collected unless this option is set to \fItrue\fR
specifically.
.IP "\fBLocalPort\fR \fIPort\fR" 4
.IX Item "LocalPort Port"
Count the connections to a specific local port. This can be used to see how
many connections are handled by a specific daemon, e.\ g. the mailserver.
You have to specify the port in numeric form, so for the mailserver example
you'd need to set \fB25\fR.
.IP "\fBRemotePort\fR \fIPort\fR" 4
.IX Item "RemotePort Port"
Count the connections to a specific remote port. This is useful to see how
much a remote service is used. This is most useful if you want to know how many
connections a local service has opened to remote services, e.\ g. how many
connections a mail server or news server has to other mail or news servers, or
how many connections a web proxy holds to web servers. You have to give the
port in numeric form.
.IP "\fBAllPortsSummary\fR \fItrue\fR|\fIfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "AllPortsSummary true|false"
If this option is set to \fItrue\fR a summary of statistics from all connections
are collected. This option defaults to \fIfalse\fR.

\&\f(CW\*(C`procfs\*(C'\fR interface. By setting this option to \fItrue\fR, you can force the
plugin to use the latter. This option defaults to \fIfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBDevice\fR \fIDevice\fR" 4

Selects the name of the thermal device that you want to collect or ignore,
depending on the value of the \fBIgnoreSelected\fR option. This option may be

Reading data from \s-1CPU\s0 has side-effect: collectd process's \s-1CPU\s0 affinity mask
changes. After reading data is completed, affinity mask needs to be restored.

On some systems, \fBsched_getaffinity()\fR will fail due to inconsistency of the \s-1CPU\s0
set size between userspace and kernel. In these cases plugin will detect the
unsuccessful call and fail with an error, preventing data collection.
Most of configurations does not need to save affinity as Collectd process is
allowed to run on any/all available CPUs.

Select which domains and devices are collected.
.Sp
If \fIIgnoreSelected\fR is not given or \fBfalse\fR then only the listed domains and
disk/network devices are collected.
.Sp
If \fIIgnoreSelected\fR is \fBtrue\fR then the test is reversed and the listed
domains and disk/network devices are ignored, while the rest are collected.
.Sp
The domain name and device names may use a regular expression, if the name is

\&\fBNote:\fR \fBBlockDevice\fR and \fBInterfaceDevice\fR options are related to
corresponding \fB*Format\fR options. Specifically, \fBBlockDevice\fR filtering depends
on \fBBlockDeviceFormat\fR setting \- if user wants to filter block devices by
\&'target' name then \fBBlockDeviceFormat\fR option has to be set to 'target' and
\&\fBBlockDevice\fR option must be set to a valid block device target
name(\*(L"/:hdb/\*(R"). Mixing formats and filter values from different worlds (i.e.,
using 'target' name as \fBBlockDevice\fR value with \fBBlockDeviceFormat\fR set to
\&'source') may lead to unexpected results (all devices filtered out or all
visible, depending on the value of \fBIgnoreSelected\fR option).
Similarly, option \fBInterfaceDevice\fR is related to \fBInterfaceFormat\fR setting
(i.e., when user wants to use \s-1MAC\s0 address as a filter then \fBInterfaceFormat\fR
has to be set to 'address' \- using wrong type here may filter out all of the
interfaces).
.Sp
\&\fBExample 1:\fR
.Sp
Ignore all \fIhdb\fR devices on any domain, but other block devices (eg. \fIhda\fR)
will be collected:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& BlockDevice "/:hdb/"
\& IgnoreSelected "true"
\& BlockDeviceFormat "target"
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fBExample 2:\fR
.Sp
Collect metrics only for block device on 'baremetal0' domain when its
\&'source' matches given path:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& BlockDevice "baremetal0:/var/lib/libvirt/images/baremetal0.qcow2"
\& BlockDeviceFormat source
.Ve
.Sp
As you can see it is possible to filter devices/interfaces using
various formats \- for block devices 'target' or 'source' name can be
used.  Interfaces can be filtered using 'name', 'address' or 'number'.
.Sp
\&\fBExample 3:\fR
.Sp
Collect metrics only for domains 'baremetal0' and 'baremetal1' and
ignore any other domain:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& Domain "baremetal0"
\& Domain "baremetal1"
.Ve
.Sp
It is possible to filter multiple block devices/domains/interfaces by
adding multiple filtering entries in separate lines.

When the virt plugin logs data, it sets the hostname of the collected data
according to this setting. The default is to use the guest name as provided by
the hypervisor, which is equal to setting \fBname\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBuuid\fR means use the guest's \s-1UUID.\s0 This is useful if you want to track the
same guest across migrations.
.Sp
\&\fBhostname\fR means to use the global \fBHostname\fR setting, which is probably not
useful on its own because all guests will appear to have the same name. This is
useful in conjunction with \fBPluginInstanceFormat\fR though.
.Sp
\&\fBmetadata\fR means use information from guest's metadata. Use
\&\fBHostnameMetadataNS\fR and \fBHostnameMetadataXPath\fR to localize this information.
.Sp
You can also specify combinations of these fields. For example \fBname uuid\fR
means to concatenate the guest name and \s-1UUID\s0 (with a literal colon character
between, thus \fI\*(L"foo:1234\-1234\-1234\-1234\*(R"\fR).

.Sp
\&\fBaddress\fR means use the interface's mac address. This is useful since the

When \fIcollectd\fR connects to a \s-1TSDB\s0 node, it will request the hostname from
\&\s-1DNS.\s0 This can become a problem if the \s-1TSDB\s0 node is unavailable or badly
configured because collectd will request \s-1DNS\s0 in order to reconnect for every
metric, which can flood your \s-1DNS.\s0 So you can cache the last value for
\&\fIResolveInterval\fR seconds.
Defaults to the \fIInterval\fR of the \fIwrite_tsdb plugin\fR, e.g. 10\ seconds.
.Sp
You can also define a jitter, a random interval to wait in addition to
\&\fIResolveInterval\fR. This prevents all your collectd servers to resolve the
hostname at the same time when the connection fails.

.IX Item "StalenessDelta Seconds"
Time in seconds after which \fIPrometheus\fR considers a metric \*(L"stale\*(R" if it
hasn't seen any update for it. This value must match the setting in Prometheus.
It defaults to \fB300\fR seconds (5 minutes), same as Prometheus.
.Sp
\&\fBBackground:\fR
.Sp
\&\fIPrometheus\fR has a global setting, \f(CW\*(C`StalenessDelta\*(C'\fR, which controls after
which time a metric without updates is considered \*(L"stale\*(R". This setting
effectively puts an upper limit on the interval in which metrics are reported.
.Sp
When the \fIwrite_prometheus plugin\fR encounters a metric with an interval
exceeding this limit, it will inform you, the user, and provide the metric to
\&\fIPrometheus\fR \fBwithout\fR a timestamp. That causes \fIPrometheus\fR to consider the
metric \*(L"fresh\*(R" each time it is scraped, with the time of the scrape being
considered the time of the update. The result is that there appear more
datapoints in \fIPrometheus\fR than were actually created, but at least the metric
doesn't disappear periodically.

.IP "\fBBufferSize\fR \fIBytes\fR" 4
.IX Item "BufferSize Bytes"
Sets the send buffer size to \fIBytes\fR. By increasing this buffer, less \s-1HTTP\s0
requests will be generated, but more metrics will be batched / metrics are
cached for longer before being sent, introducing additional delay until they
are available on the server side. \fIBytes\fR must be at least 1024 and cannot

.SH "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION"
Starting with version \f(CW4.3.0\fR collectd has support for \fBmonitoring\fR. By that
we mean that the values are not only stored or sent somewhere, but that they
are judged and, if a problem is recognized, acted upon. The only action
collectd takes itself is to generate and dispatch a \*(L"notification\*(R". Plugins can
register to receive notifications and perform appropriate further actions.
.PP
Since systems and what you expect them to do differ a lot, you can configure
\&\fBthresholds\fR for your values freely. This gives you a lot of flexibility but
also a lot of responsibility.
.PP
Every time a value is out of range a notification is dispatched. This means
that the idle percentage of your \s-1CPU\s0 needs to be less then the configured
threshold only once for a notification to be generated. There's no such thing
as a moving average or similar \- at least not now.
.PP
Also, all values that match a threshold are considered to be relevant or
\&\*(L"interesting\*(R". As a consequence collectd will issue a notification if they are
not received for \fBTimeout\fR iterations. The \fBTimeout\fR configuration option is
explained in section \*(L"\s-1GLOBAL OPTIONS\*(R"\s0. If, for example, \fBTimeout\fR is set to
\&\*(L"2\*(R" (the default) and some hosts sends it's \s-1CPU\s0 statistics to the server every
60 seconds, a notification will be dispatched after about 120 seconds. It may
take a little longer because the timeout is checked only once each \fBInterval\fR
on the server.
.PP
When a value comes within range again or is received after it was missing, an
\&\*(L"OKAY-notification\*(R" is dispatched.
.PP
Here is a configuration example to get you started. Read below for more
information.

There are basically two types of configuration statements: The \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks select the value for which a threshold should be
configured. The \f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks may be specified further using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Instance\*(C'\fR option. You can combine the block by nesting the blocks, though
they must be nested in the above order, i.\ e. \f(CW\*(C`Host\*(C'\fR may contain either
\&\f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks, \f(CW\*(C`Plugin\*(C'\fR may only contain \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR blocks and
\&\f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR may not contain other blocks. If multiple blocks apply to the same
value the most specific block is used.
.PP
The other statements specify the threshold to configure. They \fBmust\fR be
included in a \f(CW\*(C`Type\*(C'\fR block. Currently the following statements are recognized:
.IP "\fBFailureMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "FailureMax Value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWarningMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "WarningMax Value"
.PD
Sets the upper bound of acceptable values. If unset defaults to positive
infinity. If a value is greater than \fBFailureMax\fR a \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR notification
will be created. If the value is greater than \fBWarningMax\fR but less than (or
equal to) \fBFailureMax\fR a \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR notification will be created.
.IP "\fBFailureMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "FailureMin Value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBWarningMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "WarningMin Value"
.PD
Sets the lower bound of acceptable values. If unset defaults to negative
infinity. If a value is less than \fBFailureMin\fR a \fB\s-1FAILURE\s0\fR notification will
be created. If the value is less than \fBWarningMin\fR but greater than (or equal
to) \fBFailureMin\fR a \fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR notification will be created.
.IP "\fBDataSource\fR \fIDSName\fR" 4
.IX Item "DataSource DSName"
Some data sets have more than one \*(L"data source\*(R". Interesting examples are the
\&\f(CW\*(C`if_octets\*(C'\fR data set, which has received (\f(CW\*(C`rx\*(C'\fR) and sent (\f(CW\*(C`tx\*(C'\fR) bytes and
the \f(CW\*(C`disk_ops\*(C'\fR data set, which holds \f(CW\*(C`read\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR operations. The
system load data set, \f(CW\*(C`load\*(C'\fR, even has three data sources: \f(CW\*(C`shortterm\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`midterm\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`longterm\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Normally, all data sources are checked against a configured threshold. If this
is undesirable, or if you want to specify different limits for each data
source, you can use the \fBDataSource\fR option to have a threshold apply only to
one data source.
.IP "\fBInvert\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Invert true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR the range of acceptable values is inverted, i.\ e.
values between \fBFailureMin\fR and \fBFailureMax\fR (\fBWarningMin\fR and
\&\fBWarningMax\fR) are not okay. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBPersist\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Persist true|false"
Sets how often notifications are generated. If set to \fBtrue\fR one notification
will be generated for each value that is out of the acceptable range. If set to
\&\fBfalse\fR (the default) then a notification is only generated if a value is out
of range but the previous value was okay.
.Sp
This applies to missing values, too: If set to \fBtrue\fR a notification about a
missing value is generated once every \fBInterval\fR seconds. If set to \fBfalse\fR
only one such notification is generated until the value appears again.
.IP "\fBPercentage\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Percentage true|false"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, the minimum and maximum values given are interpreted as
percentage value, relative to the other data sources. This is helpful for
example for the \*(L"df\*(R" type, where you may want to issue a warning when less than
5\ % of the total space is available. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP "\fBHits\fR \fINumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hits Number"
Delay creating the notification until the threshold has been passed \fINumber\fR
times. When a notification has been generated, or when a subsequent value is
inside the threshold, the counter is reset. If, for example, a value is
collected once every 10\ seconds and \fBHits\fR is set to 3, a notification
will be dispatched at most once every 30\ seconds.
.Sp
This is useful when short bursts are not a problem. If, for example, 100% \s-1CPU\s0
usage for up to a minute is normal (and data is collected every
10\ seconds), you could set \fBHits\fR to \fB6\fR to account for this.
.IP "\fBHysteresis\fR \fINumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hysteresis Number"
When set to non-zero, a hysteresis value is applied when checking minimum and
maximum bounds. This is useful for values that increase slowly and fluctuate a
bit while doing so. When these values come close to the threshold, they may
\&\*(L"flap\*(R", i.e. switch between failure / warning case and okay case repeatedly.
.Sp
If, for example, the threshold is configures as
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  WarningMax 100.0
\&  Hysteresis 1.0
.Ve
.Sp
then a \fIWarning\fR notification is created when the value exceeds \fI101\fR and the
corresponding \fIOkay\fR notification is only created once the value falls below
\&\fI99\fR, thus avoiding the \*(L"flapping\*(R".
.SH "FILTER CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "FILTER CONFIGURATION"
Starting with collectd 4.6 there is a powerful filtering infrastructure
implemented in the daemon. The concept has mostly been copied from
\&\fIip_tables\fR, the packet filter infrastructure for Linux. We'll use a similar
terminology, so that users that are familiar with iptables feel right at home.
.SS "Terminology"
.IX Subsection "Terminology"
The following are the terms used in the remainder of the filter configuration
documentation. For an ASCII-art schema of the mechanism, see
\&\*(L"General structure\*(R" below.
.IP "\fBMatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "Match"
A \fImatch\fR is a criteria to select specific values. Examples are, of course, the
name of the value or it's current value.
.Sp
Matches are implemented in plugins which you have to load prior to using the
match. The name of such plugins starts with the \*(L"match_\*(R" prefix.
.IP "\fBTarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "Target"
A \fItarget\fR is some action that is to be performed with data. Such actions
could, for example, be to change part of the value's identifier or to ignore
the value completely.
.Sp
Some of these targets are built into the daemon, see \*(L"Built-in targets\*(R"
below. Other targets are implemented in plugins which you have to load prior to
using the target. The name of such plugins starts with the \*(L"target_\*(R" prefix.
.IP "\fBRule\fR" 4
.IX Item "Rule"
The combination of any number of matches and at least one target is called a
\&\fIrule\fR. The target actions will be performed for all values for which \fBall\fR
matches apply. If the rule does not have any matches associated with it, the
target action will be performed for all values.
.IP "\fBChain\fR" 4
.IX Item "Chain"
A \fIchain\fR is a list of rules and possibly default targets. The rules are tried
in order and if one matches, the associated target will be called. If a value
is handled by a rule, it depends on the target whether or not any subsequent
rules are considered or if traversal of the chain is aborted, see
\&\*(L"Flow control\*(R" below. After all rules have been checked, the default targets
will be executed.

.SS "Flow control"
.IX Subsection "Flow control"
There are four ways to control which way a value takes through the filter
mechanism:
.IP "\fBjump\fR" 4
.IX Item "jump"
The built-in \fBjump\fR target can be used to \*(L"call\*(R" another chain, i.\ e.
process the value with another chain. When the called chain finishes, usually
the next target or rule after the jump is executed.
.IP "\fBstop\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop"
The stop condition, signaled for example by the built-in target \fBstop\fR, causes
all processing of the value to be stopped immediately.
.IP "\fBreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "return"
Causes processing in the current chain to be aborted, but processing of the
value generally will continue. This means that if the chain was called via
\&\fBJump\fR, the next target or rule after the jump will be executed. If the chain
was not called by another chain, control will be returned to the daemon and it
may pass the value to another chain.
.IP "\fBcontinue\fR" 4
.IX Item "continue"
Most targets will signal the \fBcontinue\fR condition, meaning that processing
should continue normally. There is no special built-in target for this
condition.
.SS "Synopsis"
.IX Subsection "Synopsis"
The configuration reflects this structure directly:
.PP
.Vb 10
\& PostCacheChain "PostCache"
\& <Chain "PostCache">
\&   <Rule "ignore_mysql_show">
\&     <Match "regex">

\&     </Target>
\&   </Rule>
\&   <Target "write">
\&     Plugin "rrdtool"
\&   </Target>
\& </Chain>
.Ve
.PP
The above configuration example will ignore all values where the plugin field
is \*(L"mysql\*(R", the type is \*(L"mysql_command\*(R" and the type instance begins with
\&\*(L"show_\*(R". All other values will be sent to the \f(CW\*(C`rrdtool\*(C'\fR write plugin via the
default target of the chain. Since this chain is run after the value has been
added to the cache, the MySQL \f(CW\*(C`show_*\*(C'\fR command statistics will be available
via the \f(CW\*(C`unixsock\*(C'\fR plugin.
.SS "List of configuration options"

Configure the name of the \*(L"pre-cache chain\*(R" and the \*(L"post-cache chain\*(R". The

.Ve
.Sp
After the values are passed from the \*(L"read\*(R" plugins to the dispatch functions,
the pre-cache chain is run first. The values are added to the internal cache
afterwards. The post-cache chain is run after the values have been added to the
cache. So why is it such a huge deal if chains are run before or after the
values have been added to this cache?
.Sp
Targets that change the identifier of a value list should be executed before
the values are added to the cache, so that the name in the cache matches the
name that is used in the \*(L"write\*(R" plugins. The \f(CW\*(C`unixsock\*(C'\fR plugin, too, uses
this cache to receive a list of all available values. If you change the
identifier after the value list has been added to the cache, this may easily
lead to confusion, but it's not forbidden of course.
.Sp
The cache is also used to convert counter values to rates. These rates are, for
example, used by the \f(CW\*(C`value\*(C'\fR match (see below). If you use the rate stored in
the cache \fBbefore\fR the new value is added, you will use the old, \fBprevious\fR
rate. Write plugins may use this rate, too, see the \f(CW\*(C`csv\*(C'\fR plugin, for example.
The \f(CW\*(C`unixsock\*(C'\fR plugin uses these rates too, to implement the \f(CW\*(C`GETVAL\*(C'\fR
command.
.Sp
Last but not last, the \fBstop\fR target makes a difference: If the pre-cache
chain returns the stop condition, the value will not be added to the cache and
the post-cache chain will not be run.
.IP "\fBChain\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Chain Name"
Adds a new chain with a certain name. This name can be used to refer to a
specific chain, for example to jump to it.
.Sp
Within the \fBChain\fR block, there can be \fBRule\fR blocks and \fBTarget\fR blocks.
.IP "\fBRule\fR [\fIName\fR]" 4
.IX Item "Rule [Name]"
Adds a new rule to the current chain. The name of the rule is optional and
currently has no meaning for the daemon.
.Sp
Within the \fBRule\fR block, there may be any number of \fBMatch\fR blocks and there
must be at least one \fBTarget\fR block.
.IP "\fBMatch\fR \fIName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Match Name"
Adds a match to a \fBRule\fR block. The name specifies what kind of match should
be performed. Available matches depend on the plugins that have been loaded.
.Sp
The arguments inside the \fBMatch\fR block are passed to the plugin implementing
the match, so which arguments are valid here depends on the plugin being used.
If you do not need any to pass any arguments to a match, you can use the
shorter syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& Match "foobar"

plugins to be loaded:
.IP "\fBreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "return"
Signals the \*(L"return\*(R" condition, see the \*(L"Flow control\*(R" section above. This
causes the current chain to stop processing the value and returns control to
the calling chain. The calling chain will continue processing targets and rules
just after the \fBjump\fR target (see below). This is very similar to the
\&\fB\s-1RETURN\s0\fR target of iptables, see \fBiptables\fR\|(8).

This match is mainly intended for servers that receive values over the

is very sensitive to the timestamp used when updating the \s-1RRD\s0 files. In
particular, the time must be ever increasing. If a misbehaving client sends one
packet with a timestamp far in the future, all further packets with a correct
time will be ignored because of that one packet. What's worse, such corrupted

This match lets one match all values \fBoutside\fR a specified time range
(relative to the server's time), so you can use the \fBstop\fR target (see below)
to ignore the value, for example.
.Sp
Available options:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBFuture\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Future Seconds"
Matches all values that are \fIahead\fR of the server's time by \fISeconds\fR or more
seconds. Set to zero for no limit. Either \fBFuture\fR or \fBPast\fR must be
non-zero.
.IP "\fBPast\fR \fISeconds\fR" 4
.IX Item "Past Seconds"
Matches all values that are \fIbehind\fR of the server's time by \fISeconds\fR or
more seconds. Set to zero for no limit. Either \fBFuture\fR or \fBPast\fR must be
non-zero.

.IP "\fBvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "value"
Matches the actual value of data sources against given minimum\ / maximum
values. If a data-set consists of more than one data-source, all data-sources
must match the specified ranges for a positive match.
.Sp
Available options:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBMin\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "Min Value"
Sets the smallest value which still results in a match. If unset, behaves like
negative infinity.
.IP "\fBMax\fR \fIValue\fR" 4
.IX Item "Max Value"
Sets the largest value which still results in a match. If unset, behaves like
positive infinity.
.IP "\fBInvert\fR \fBtrue\fR|\fBfalse\fR" 4
.IX Item "Invert true|false"
Inverts the selection. If the \fBMin\fR and \fBMax\fR settings result in a match,
no-match is returned and vice versa. Please note that the \fBInvert\fR setting
only effects how \fBMin\fR and \fBMax\fR are applied to a specific value. Especially
the \fBDataSource\fR and \fBSatisfy\fR settings (see below) are not inverted.
.IP "\fBDataSource\fR \fIDSName\fR [\fIDSName\fR ...]" 4
.IX Item "DataSource DSName [DSName ...]"
Select one or more of the data sources. If no data source is configured, all
data sources will be checked. If the type handled by the match does not have a
data source of the specified name(s), this will always result in no match
(independent of the \fBInvert\fR setting).
.IP "\fBSatisfy\fR \fBAny\fR|\fBAll\fR" 4
.IX Item "Satisfy Any|All"
Specifies how checking with several data sources is performed. If set to
\&\fBAny\fR, the match succeeds if one of the data sources is in the configured
range. If set to \fBAll\fR the match only succeeds if all data sources are within
the configured range. Default is \fBAll\fR.
.Sp
Usually \fBAll\fR is used for positive matches, \fBAny\fR is used for negative
matches. This means that with \fBAll\fR you usually check that all values are in a
\&\*(L"good\*(R" range, while with \fBAny\fR you check if any value is within a \*(L"bad\*(R" range
(or outside the \*(L"good\*(R" range).

Either \fBMin\fR or \fBMax\fR, but not both, may be unset.

\& # sources are below 100.

.RE
.IP "\fBempty_counter\fR" 4
.IX Item "empty_counter"
Matches all values with one or more data sources of type \fB\s-1COUNTER\s0\fR and where
all counter values are zero. These counters usually \fInever\fR increased since
they started existing (and are therefore uninteresting), or got reset recently
or overflowed and you had really, \fIreally\fR bad luck.
.Sp
Please keep in mind that ignoring such counters can result in confusing
behavior: Counters which hardly ever increase will be zero for long periods of
time. If the counter is reset for some reason (machine or service restarted,
usually), the graph will be empty (\s-1NAN\s0) for a long time. People may not
understand why.
.IP "\fBhashed\fR" 4
.IX Item "hashed"
Calculates a hash value of the host name and matches values according to that
hash value. This makes it possible to divide all hosts into groups and match
only values that are in a specific group. The intended use is in load
balancing, where you want to handle only part of all data and leave the rest
for other servers.
.Sp
The hashing function used tries to distribute the hosts evenly. First, it
calculates a 32\ bit hash value using the characters of the hostname:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  hash_value = 0;
\&  for (i = 0; host[i] != 0; i++)
\&    hash_value = (hash_value * 251) + host[i];
.Ve
.Sp
The constant 251 is a prime number which is supposed to make this hash value
more random. The code then checks the group for this host according to the
\&\fITotal\fR and \fIMatch\fR arguments:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  if ((hash_value % Total) == Match)
\&    matches;
\&  else
\&    does not match;
.Ve
.Sp
Please note that when you set \fITotal\fR to two (i.\ e. you have only two
groups), then the least significant bit of the hash value will be the \s-1XOR\s0 of
all least significant bits in the host name. One consequence is that when you
have two hosts, \*(L"server0.example.com\*(R" and \*(L"server1.example.com\*(R", where the host
name differs in one digit only and the digits differ by one, those hosts will
never end up in the same group.
.Sp
Available options:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBMatch\fR \fIMatch\fR \fITotal\fR" 4
.IX Item "Match Match Total"
Divide the data into \fITotal\fR groups and match all hosts in group \fIMatch\fR as
described above. The groups are numbered from zero, i.\ e. \fIMatch\fR must
be smaller than \fITotal\fR. \fITotal\fR must be at least one, although only values
greater than one really do make any sense.
.Sp
You can repeat this option to match multiple groups, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Match 3 7
\&  Match 5 7
.Ve
.Sp
The above config will divide the data into seven groups and match groups three
and five. One use would be to keep every value on two hosts so that if one
fails the missing data can later be reconstructed from the second host.

\&\fBIgnorelists\fR are a generic framework to either ignore some metrics or report
specific metrics only. Plugins usually provide one or more options to specify
the items (mounts points, devices, ...) and the boolean option
\&\f(CW\*(C`IgnoreSelected\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBSelect\fR \fIString\fR" 4
.IX Item "Select String"
Selects the item \fIString\fR. This option often has a plugin specific name, e.g.
\&\fBSensor\fR in the \f(CW\*(C`sensors\*(C'\fR plugin. It is also plugin specific what this string
is compared to. For example, the \f(CW\*(C`df\*(C'\fR plugin's \fBMountPoint\fR compares it to a
mount point and the \f(CW\*(C`sensors\*(C'\fR plugin's \fBSensor\fR compares it to a sensor name.
.Sp
By default, this option is doing a case-sensitive full-string match. The
following config will match \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR, but not \f(CW\*(C`Foo\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Select "foo"
.Ve
.Sp
If \fIString\fR starts and ends with \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR (a slash), the string is compiled as a
\&\fIregular expression\fR. For example, so match all item starting with \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR, use
could use the following syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Select "/^foo/"
