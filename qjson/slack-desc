# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

qjson:
qjson: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
qjson: format. It can represents integer, real number, string, an ordered
qjson: sequence of value, and a collection of name/value pairs.
qjson: QJson is a qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects:
qjson: JSON arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances, while JSON
qjson: objects will be mapped to QVariantMap.
