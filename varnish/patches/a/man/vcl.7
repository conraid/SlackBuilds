.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The VCL language is a small domain\-specific language designed to be
used to describe request handling and document caching policies for
Varnish Cache.
.sp
When a new configuration is loaded, the varnishd management process
translates the VCL code to C and compiles it to a shared object which
is then loaded into the server process.
.sp
This document focuses on the syntax of the VCL language. For a full
description of syntax and semantics, with ample examples, please see
the online documentation at \fI\%https://www.varnish\-cache.org/docs/\fP .
.sp
Starting with Varnish 4.0, each VCL file must start by declaring its
version with \fBvcl\fP \fI<major>.<minor>\fP\fB;\fP marker at the top of
the file.  See more about this under Versioning below.
.SS Operators
.sp
The following operators are available in VCL:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB=\fP
Assignment operator.
.TP
.B \fB==\fP
Comparison.
.TP
.B \fB~\fP
Match. Can either be used with regular expressions or ACLs.
.TP
.B \fB!\fP
Negation.
.TP
.B \fB&&\fP
Logical and.
.TP
.B \fB||\fP
Logical or.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Conditionals
.sp
VCL has \fBif\fP and \fBelse\fP statements. Nested logic can be
implemented with the \fBelseif\fP statement (\fBelsif\fP/\fBelif\fP/\fBelse if\fP are equivalent).
.sp
Note that there are no loops or iterators of any kind in VCL.
.SS Strings, booleans, time, duration, integers and real numbers
.sp
These are the data types in Varnish. You can \fBset\fP or \fBunset\fP these.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set req.http.User\-Agent = "unknown";
unset req.http.Range;
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Strings
.sp
Basic strings are enclosed in double quotes \fB"\fP\fI\&...\fP\fB"\fP, and
may not contain newlines. Long strings are enclosed in
\fB{"\fP\fI\&...\fP\fB"}\fP\&. They may contain any character including single
double quotes \fB"\fP, newline and other control characters except for the
\fINUL\fP (0x00) character.
.SS Booleans
.sp
Booleans can be either \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP\&.  In addition, in a boolean
context some data types will evaluate to \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP depending on
their value.
.sp
String types will evaluate to \fBfalse\fP if they are unset.  This allows
checks of the type \fBif (req.http.opthdr) {}\fP to test if a header
exists, even if it is empty, whereas \fBif (req.http.opthdr == "") {}\fP
does not distinguish if the header does not exist or if it is empty.
.sp
Backend types
will evaluate to \fBfalse\fP if they don\(aqt have a backend assigned; integer
types will evaluate to \fBfalse\fP if their value is zero; duration types
will evaluate to \fBfalse\fP if their value is equal or less than zero.
.SS Time
.sp
VCL has time. A duration can be added to a time to make another time.
In string context they return a formatted string in RFC1123 format,
e.g. \fBSun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT\fP\&.
.sp
The keyword \fBnow\fP returns a notion of the current time, which is
kept consistent during vcl subroutine invocations, so during the
execution of a vcl subroutine callback (\fBvcl_* {}\fP), including all
user\-defined subroutines being called, \fBnow\fP always returns the
same value.
.SS Durations
.sp
Durations are defined by a number followed by a unit. The number can
include a fractional part, e.g. \fB1.5s\fP\&. The supported units are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBms\fP
milliseconds
.TP
.B \fBs\fP
seconds
.TP
.B \fBm\fP
minutes
.TP
.B \fBh\fP
hours
.TP
.B \fBd\fP
days
.TP
.B \fBw\fP
weeks
.TP
.B \fBy\fP
years
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In string context they return a string with their value rounded to
3 decimal places and excluding the unit, e.g.  \fB1.500\fP\&.
.SS Integers
.sp
Certain fields are integers, used as expected. In string context they
return a string, e.g. \fB1234\fP\&.
.SS Real numbers
.sp
VCL understands real numbers. In string context they return a string
with their value rounded to 3 decimal places, e.g. \fB3.142\fP\&.
.SS Regular Expressions
.sp
Varnish uses Perl\-compatible regular expressions (PCRE). For a
complete description please see the pcre(3) man page.
.sp
To send flags to the PCRE engine, such as to do case insensitive matching, add
the flag within parens following a question mark, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# If host is NOT example dot com..
if (req.http.host !~ "(?i)example\e.com$") {
    ...
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Include statement
.sp
To include a VCL file in another file use the include keyword:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include "foo.vcl";
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Import statement
.sp
The \fBimport\fP statement is used to load Varnish Modules (VMODs.)
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import std;
sub vcl_recv {
    std.log("foo");
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Comments
.sp
Single lines of VCL can be commented out using \fB//\fP or
\fB#\fP\&. Multi\-line blocks can be commented out with
\fB/*\fP\fIblock\fP\fB*/\fP\&.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_recv {
    // Single line of out\-commented VCL.
    # Another way of commenting out a single line.
    /*
        Multi\-line block of commented\-out VCL.
    */
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Backend definition
.sp
A backend declaration creates and initialises a named backend object. A
declaration start with the keyword \fBbackend\fP followed by the name of the
backend. The actual declaration is in curly brackets, in a key/value fashion.:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
backend name {
    .attribute = "value";
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
One of the attributes \fB\&.host\fP or \fB\&.path\fP is mandatory (but not
both). The attributes will inherit their defaults from the global
parameters. The following attributes are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.host\fP
The host to be used. IP address or a hostname that resolves to a
single IP address. This attribute is mandatory, unless \fB\&.path\fP
is declared.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\&.path\fP     (\fBVCL >= 4.1\fP)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The absolute path of a Unix domain socket at which a backend is
listening. If the file at that path does not exist or is not
accessible to Varnish at VCL load time, then the VCL compiler
issues a warning, but does not fail. This makes it possible to
start the UDS\-listening peer, or set the socket file\(aqs
permissions, after starting Varnish or loading VCL with a UDS
backend.  But the socket file must exist and have necessary
permissions before the first connection is attempted, otherwise
fetches will fail. If the file does exist and is accessible, then
it must be a socket; otherwise the VCL load fails. One of
\fB\&.path\fP or \fB\&.host\fP must be declared (but not both). \fB\&.path\fP
may only be used in VCL since version 4.1.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.port\fP
The port on the backend that Varnish should connect to. Ignored if
a Unix domain socket is declared in \fB\&.path\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.host_header\fP
A host header to add to probes and regular backend requests if they have no
such header.
.TP
.B \fB\&.connect_timeout\fP
Timeout for connections.
.sp
Default: \fBconnect_timeout\fP parameter, see \fIvarnishd(1)\fP
.TP
.B \fB\&.first_byte_timeout\fP
Timeout for first byte.
.sp
Default: \fBfirst_byte_timeout\fP parameter, see \fIvarnishd(1)\fP
.TP
.B \fB\&.between_bytes_timeout\fP
Timeout between bytes.
.sp
Default: \fBbetween_bytes_timeout\fP parameter, see \fIvarnishd(1)\fP
.TP
.B \fB\&.probe\fP
Attach a probe to the backend. See \fI\%Probes\fP
.TP
.B \fB\&.proxy_header\fP
The PROXY protocol version Varnish should use when connecting to
this backend. Allowed values are \fB1\fP and \fB2\fP\&.
.sp
\fINotice\fP this setting will lead to backend connections being used
for a single request only (subject to future improvements). Thus,
extra care should be taken to avoid running into failing backend
connections with EADDRNOTAVAIL due to no local ports being
available. Possible options are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use additional backend connections to extra IP addresses or TCP
ports
.IP \(bu 2
Increase the number of available ports (Linux sysctl
\fBnet.ipv4.ip_local_port_range\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Reuse backend connection ports early (Linux sysctl
\fBnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse\fP)
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\&.max_connections\fP
Maximum number of open connections towards this backend. If
Varnish reaches the maximum Varnish it will start failing
connections.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Backends can be used with \fIdirectors\fP\&. Please see the
\fIvmod_directors(3)\fP man page for more information.
.SS Probes
.sp
Probes will query the backend for status on a regular basis and mark
the backend as down it they fail. A probe is defined as this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
probe name {
    .attribute = "value";
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The probe named \fBdefault\fP is special and will be used for all backends
which do not explicitly reference a probe.
.sp
There are no mandatory options. These are the options you can set:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.url\fP
The URL to query. Defaults to \fB/\fP\&.
Mutually exclusive with \fB\&.request\fP
.TP
.B \fB\&.request\fP
Specify a full HTTP request using multiple strings. \fB\&.request\fP will
have \fB\er\en\fP automatically inserted after every string.
Mutually exclusive with \fB\&.url\fP\&.
.sp
\fINote\fP that probes require the backend to complete sending the
response and close the connection within the specified timeout, so
\fB\&.request\fP will, for \fBHTTP/1.1\fP, most likely need to contain a
\fB"Connection: close"\fP string.
.TP
.B \fB\&.expected_response\fP
The expected HTTP response code. Defaults to \fB200\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.timeout\fP
The timeout for the probe. Default is \fB2s\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.interval\fP
How often the probe is run. Default is \fB5s\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.initial\fP
How many of the polls in \fB\&.window\fP are considered good when Varnish
starts. Defaults to the value of \fB\&.threshold\fP \- 1. In this case, the
backend starts as sick and requires one single poll to be
considered healthy.
.TP
.B \fB\&.window\fP
How many of the latest polls we examine to determine backend health.
Defaults to \fB8\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.threshold\fP
How many of the polls in \fB\&.window\fP must have succeeded to
consider the backend to be healthy.
Defaults to \fB3\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Access Control List (ACL)
.sp
An Access Control List (ACL) declaration creates and initialises a named access
control list which can later be used to match client addresses:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
acl localnetwork {
    "localhost";    # myself
    "192.0.2.0"/24; # and everyone on the local network
    ! "192.0.2.23"; # except for the dial\-in router
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If an ACL entry specifies a host name which Varnish is unable to
resolve, it will match any address it is compared to. Consequently,
if it is preceded by a negation mark, it will reject any address it is
compared to, which may not be what you intended. If the entry is
enclosed in parentheses, however, it will simply be ignored.
.sp
To match an IP address against an ACL, simply use the match operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if (client.ip ~ localnetwork) {
    return (pipe);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS VCL objects
.sp
A VCL object can be instantiated with the \fBnew\fP keyword:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_init {
    new b = directors.round_robin()
    b.add_backend(node1);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is only available in \fBvcl_init\fP\&.
.SS Subroutines
.sp
A subroutine is used to group code for legibility or reusability:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub pipe_if_local {
    if (client.ip ~ localnetwork) {
        return (pipe);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Subroutines in VCL do not take arguments, nor do they return
values. The built in subroutines all have names beginning with \fBvcl_\fP,
which is reserved.
.sp
To call a subroutine, use the \fBcall\fP keyword followed by the
subroutine\(aqs name:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_recv {
    call pipe_if_local;
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Return statements
.sp
The ongoing \fBvcl_*\fP subroutine execution ends when a
\fBreturn(\fP\fI<action>\fP\fB)\fP statement is made.
.sp
The \fI<action>\fP specifies how execution should proceed. The context
defines which actions are available.
.SS Multiple subroutines
.sp
If multiple subroutines with the name of one of the built\-in ones are defined,
they are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the source.
.sp
The built\-in VCL distributed with Varnish will be implicitly concatenated
when the VCL is compiled.
.SS VCL Variables
.sp
Variables provide read, write and delete access to almost all aspects
of the work at hand.
.sp
Reading a variable is done simply by using its name in VCL:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if (client.ip ~ bad_guys) {
    return (synth(400));
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Writing a variable, where this is possible, is done with a \fIset\fP
statement:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set resp.http.never = "Let You Down";
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Similarly, deleting a variable, for the few variables where this is
possible, is done with a \fIunset\fP statement:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
unset req.http.cookie;
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Which operations are possible on each variable is described below,
often with the shorthand "backend" which covers the \fIvcl_backend_*\fP
methods and "client" which covers the rest, except \fIvcl_init\fP and
\fIvcl_fini\fP\&.
.sp
When setting a variable, the right hand side of the equal sign
must have the variables type, you cannot assign a STRING to
a variable of type NUMBER, even if the string is \fI"42"\fP\&.
(Explicit conversion functions can be found in
\fIvmod_std(3)\fP).
.SS local, server, remote and client
.sp
These variables describe the network connection between the
client and varnishd.
.sp
Without PROXY protocol:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
     client    server
     remote    local

.sp
For converting or casting VCL values between data types use the functions
available in the std VMOD.
.SH VERSIONING
.sp
Multiple versions of the VCL syntax can coexist within certain
constraints.
.sp
The VCL syntax version at the start of VCL file specified with \fB\-f\fP
sets the hard limit that cannot be exceeded anywhere, and it selects
the appropriate version of the builtin VCL.
.sp
That means that you can never include \fBvcl 9.1;\fP from \fBvcl 8.7;\fP,
but the opposite \fImay\fP be possible, to the extent the compiler
supports it.
.sp
Files pulled in via \fBinclude\fP do not need to have a
\fBvcl\fP \fIX.Y\fP\fB;\fP but it may be a good idea to do it anyway, to
not have surprises in the future.  The syntax version set in an
included file only applies to that file and any files it includes \-
unless these set their own VCL syntax version.
.sp
The version of Varnish this file belongs to supports syntax 4.0 only.
