.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fIvarnishd\fP daemon accepts HTTP requests from clients, passes them on
to a backend server and caches the returned documents to better
satisfy future requests for the same document.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Basic options
.sp
\-a <[name=][address][:port][,PROTO][,user=<user>][,group=<group>][,mode=<mode>]>
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Listen for client requests on the specified address and port. The
address can be a host name ("localhost"), an IPv4 dotted\-quad
("127.0.0.1"), an IPv6 address enclosed in square brackets
("[::1]"), or a path beginning with a \(aq/\(aq for a Unix domain socket
("/path/to/listen.sock"). If address is not specified, \fIvarnishd\fP
will listen on all available IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. If port is
not specified, port 80 (http) is used. At least one of address or
port is required.
.sp
If a Unix domain socket is specified as the listen address, then the
user, group and mode sub\-arguments may be used to specify the
permissions of the socket file \-\- use names for user and group, and
a 3\-digit octal value for mode. These sub\-arguments are not
permitted if an IP address is specified. When Unix domain socket
listeners are in use, all VCL configurations must have version >=
4.1.
.sp
Name is referenced in logs. If name is not specified, "a0", "a1",
etc. is used. An additional protocol type can be set for the
listening socket with PROTO. Valid protocol types are: HTTP
(default), and PROXY.
.sp
Multiple listening addresses can be specified by using different
\-a arguments.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-b \ <[host[:port]|path]>
Use the specified host as backend server. If port is not specified,
the default is 8080.
.sp
If the value of \fB\-b\fP begins with \fB/\fP, it is interpreted as the
absolute path of a Unix domain socket to which Varnish connects. In
that case, the value of \fB\-b\fP must satisfy the conditions required
for the \fB\&.path\fP field of a backend declaration, see \fIvcl(7)\fP\&.
Backends with Unix socket addresses may only be used with VCL
versions >= 4.1.
.sp
\-b can be used only once, and not together with f.
.TP
.BI \-f \ config
Use the specified VCL configuration file instead of the builtin
default.  See \fIvcl(7)\fP for details on VCL syntax.
.sp
If a single \-f option is used, then the VCL instance loaded from the
file is named "boot" and immediately becomes active. If more than
one \-f option is used, the VCL instances are named "boot0", "boot1"
and so forth, in the order corresponding to the \-f arguments, and
the last one is named "boot", which becomes active.
.sp
Either \-b or one or more \-f options must be specified, but not both,
and they cannot both be left out, unless \-d is used to start
\fIvarnishd\fP in debugging mode. If the empty string is specified as
the sole \-f option, then \fIvarnishd\fP starts without starting the
worker process, and the management process will accept CLI commands.
You can also combine an empty \-f option with an initialization
script (\-I option) and the child process will be started if there
is an active VCL at the end of the initialization.
.sp
When used with a relative file name, config is searched in the
\fBvcl_path\fP\&. It is possible to set this path prior to using \fB\-f\fP
options with a \fB\-p\fP option. During startup, \fIvarnishd\fP doesn\(aqt
complain about unsafe VCL paths: unlike the \fIvarnish\-cli(7)\fP that
could later be accessed remotely, starting \fIvarnishd\fP requires
local privileges.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-n \ name
Specify the name for this instance.  This name is used to construct
the name of the directory in which \fIvarnishd\fP keeps temporary files
and persistent state. If the specified name begins with a forward slash,
it is interpreted as the absolute path to the directory.
.UNINDENT
.SS Documentation options
.sp
For these options, \fIvarnishd\fP prints information to standard output
and exits. When a \-x option is used, it must be the only option (it
outputs documentation in reStructuredText, aka RST).
.sp
\-?
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Print the usage message.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-x \ parameter
Print documentation of the runtime parameters (\-p options), see
\fI\%List of Parameters\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-x \ vsl
Print documentation of the tags used in the Varnish shared memory
log, see \fIvsl(7)\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-x \ cli
Print documentation of the command line interface, see
\fIvarnish\-cli(7)\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-x \ builtin
Print the contents of the default VCL program \fBbuiltin.vcl\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-x \ optstring
Print the optstring parameter to \fBgetopt(3)\fP to help writing
wrapper scripts.
.UNINDENT
.SS Operations options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-F
Do not fork, run in the foreground. Only one of \-F or \-d can be
specified, and \-F cannot be used together with \-C.
.TP
.BI \-T \ <address[:port]>
Offer a management interface on the specified address and port. See
\fIvarnish\-cli(7)\fP for documentation of the management commands.
To disable the management interface use \fBnone\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-M \ <address:port>
Connect to this port and offer the command line interface.  Think of
it as a reverse shell. When running with \-M and there is no backend
defined the child process (the cache) will not start initially.
.TP
.BI \-P \ file
Write the PID of the process to the specified file.
.TP
.BI \-i \ identity
Specify the identity of the Varnish server. This can be accessed
using \fBserver.identity\fP from VCL and with VSM_Name() from
utilities.  If not specified the output of gethostname(3) is used.
.TP
.BI \-I \ clifile
Execute the management commands in the file given as \fBclifile\fP
before the the worker process starts, see \fI\%CLI Command File\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Tuning options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-t \ TTL
Specifies the default time to live (TTL) for cached objects. This is
a shortcut for specifying the \fIdefault_ttl\fP run\-time parameter.
.TP
.BI \-p \ <param=value>
Set the parameter specified by param to the specified value, see
\fI\%List of Parameters\fP for details. This option can be used multiple
times to specify multiple parameters.
.TP
.BI \-s \ <[name=]type[,options]>
Use the specified storage backend. See \fI\%Storage Backend\fP section.
.sp
This option can be used multiple times to specify multiple storage
files. Name is referenced in logs, VCL, statistics, etc. If name
is not specified, "s0", "s1" and so forth is used.
.TP
.BI \-l \ <vsl>
Specifies size of the space for the VSL records, shorthand for
\fB\-p vsl_space=<vsl>\fP\&. Scaling suffixes like \(aqK\(aq and \(aqM\(aq can be
used up to (G)igabytes. See \fI\%vsl_space\fP for more information.
.UNINDENT
.SS Security options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-r \ <param[,param...]>
Make the listed parameters read only. This gives the system
administrator a way to limit what the Varnish CLI can do.  Consider
making parameters such as \fIcc_command\fP, \fIvcc_allow_inline_c\fP and
\fIvmod_path\fP read only as these can potentially be used to escalate
privileges from the CLI.
.TP
.BI \-S \ secret\-file
Path to a file containing a secret used for authorizing access to
the management port. To disable authentication use \fBnone\fP\&.
.sp
If this argument is not provided, a secret drawn from the system
PRNG will be written to a file called \fB_.secret\fP in the working
directory (see \fI\%opt_n\fP) with default ownership and permissions of
the user having started varnish.
.sp
Thus, users wishing to delegate control over varnish will probably
want to create a custom secret file with appropriate permissions
(ie. readable by a unix group to delegate control to).
.TP
.BI \-j \ <jail[,jailoptions]>
Specify the jailing mechanism to use. See \fI\%Jail\fP section.
.UNINDENT
.SS Advanced, development and debugging options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d
Enables debugging mode: The parent process runs in the foreground
with a CLI connection on stdin/stdout, and the child process must be
started explicitly with a CLI command. Terminating the parent
process will also terminate the child.
.sp
Only one of \-d or \-F can be specified, and \-d cannot be used together
with \-C.
.TP
.B \-C
Print VCL code compiled to C language and exit. Specify the VCL file
to compile with the \-f option. Either \-f or \-b must be used with \-C,
and \-C cannot be used with \-F or \-d.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the version number and exit. This must be the only option.
.TP
.BI \-h \ <type[,options]>
Specifies the hash algorithm. See \fI\%Hash Algorithm\fP section for a list
of supported algorithms.
.TP
.BI \-W \ waiter
Specifies the waiter type to use.
.UNINDENT
.SS Hash Algorithm
.sp
The following hash algorithms are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-h \ critbit
self\-scaling tree structure. The default hash algorithm in Varnish
Cache 2.1 and onwards. In comparison to a more traditional B tree
the critbit tree is almost completely lockless. Do not change this
unless you are certain what you\(aqre doing.
.TP
.BI \-h \ simple_list
A simple doubly\-linked list.  Not recommended for production use.
.TP
.BI \-h \ <classic[,buckets]>
A standard hash table. The hash key is the CRC32 of the object\(aqs URL
modulo the size of the hash table.  Each table entry points to a
list of elements which share the same hash key. The buckets
parameter specifies the number of entries in the hash table.  The
default is 16383.
.UNINDENT
.SS Storage Backend
.sp
The following storage types are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-s \ <default[,size]>
The default storage type resolves to umem where available and malloc
otherwise.
.TP
.BI \-s \ <malloc[,size]>
malloc is a memory based backend.
.TP
.BI \-s \ <umem[,size]>
umem is a storage backend which is more efficient than malloc on
platforms where it is available.
.sp
See the section on umem in chapter \fIStorage backends\fP of \fIThe
Varnish Users Guide\fP for details.
.TP
.BI \-s \ <file,path[,size[,granularity[,advice]]]>
The file backend stores data in a file on disk. The file will be
accessed using mmap. Note that this storage provide no cache persistence.
.sp
The path is mandatory. If path points to a directory, a temporary
file will be created in that directory and immediately unlinked. If
path points to a non\-existing file, the file will be created.
.sp
If size is omitted, and path points to an existing file with a size
greater than zero, the size of that file will be used. If not, an
error is reported.
.sp
Granularity sets the allocation block size. Defaults to the system
page size or the filesystem block size, whichever is larger.
.sp
Advice tells the kernel how \fIvarnishd\fP expects to use this mapped
region so that the kernel can choose the appropriate read\-ahead
and caching techniques. Possible values are \fBnormal\fP, \fBrandom\fP
and \fBsequential\fP, corresponding to MADV_NORMAL, MADV_RANDOM and
MADV_SEQUENTIAL madvise() advice argument, respectively. Defaults to
\fBrandom\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-s \ <persistent,path,size>
Persistent storage. Varnish will store objects in a file in a manner
that will secure the survival of \fImost\fP of the objects in the event
of a planned or unplanned shutdown of Varnish. The persistent
storage backend has multiple issues with it and will likely be
removed from a future version of Varnish.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also prefix the type with \fBNAME=\fP to explicitly name a storage:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-s myStorage=malloc,5G
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This allows to address it more easily in VCL:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
set beresp.storage = storage.myStorage;
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the name is omitted, Varnish will name storages \fBsN\fP, starting with \fBs0\fP
and incrementing N for every new storage.
.SS Jail
.sp
Varnish jails are a generalization over various platform specific
methods to reduce the privileges of varnish processes. They may have
specific options. Available jails are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-j \ solaris
Reduce privileges(5) for \fIvarnishd\fP and sub\-process to the minimally
required set. Only available on platforms which have the setppriv(2)
call.
.TP
.BI \-j \ <unix[,user=\(gauser\(ga][,ccgroup=\(gagroup\(ga][,workuser=\(gauser\(ga]>
Default on all other platforms when \fIvarnishd\fP is started with an
effective uid of 0 ("as root").
.sp
With the \fBunix\fP jail mechanism activated, varnish will switch to
an alternative user for subprocesses and change the effective uid of
the master process whenever possible.
.sp
The optional \fIuser\fP argument specifies which alternative user to
use. It defaults to \fBvarnish\fP\&.
.sp
The optional \fIccgroup\fP argument specifies a group to add to varnish
subprocesses requiring access to a c\-compiler. There is no default.
.sp
The optional \fIworkuser\fP argument specifies an alternative user to use
for the worker process. It defaults to \fBvcache\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-j \ none
last resort jail choice: With jail mechanism \fBnone\fP, varnish will
run all processes with the privileges it was started with.
.UNINDENT
.SS Management Interface
.sp
If the \-T option was specified, \fIvarnishd\fP will offer a command\-line
management interface on the specified address and port.  The
recommended way of connecting to the command\-line management interface
is through \fIvarnishadm(1)\fP\&.
.sp
The commands available are documented in \fIvarnish\-cli(7)\fP\&.
.SS CLI Command File
.sp
The \-I option makes it possible to run arbitrary management commands
when \fIvarnishd\fP is launched, before the worker process is started. In
particular, this is the way to load configurations, apply labels to
them, and make a VCL instance active that uses those labels on
startup:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vcl.load panic /etc/varnish_panic.vcl
vcl.load siteA0 /etc/varnish_siteA.vcl
vcl.load siteB0 /etc/varnish_siteB.vcl
vcl.load siteC0 /etc/varnish_siteC.vcl
vcl.label siteA siteA0
vcl.label siteB siteB0
vcl.label siteC siteC0
vcl.load main /etc/varnish_main.vcl
vcl.use main
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Every line in the file, including the last line, must be terminated by
a newline or carriage return.
.sp
If a command in the file is prefixed with \(aq\-\(aq, failure will not abort
the startup.
.SH RUN TIME PARAMETERS

.sp
Expurge long tail content from the cache to keep the number of bans below this value. 0 disables.
.sp
When this parameter is set to a non\-zero value, the ban lurker continues to work the ban list as usual top to bottom, but when it reaches the ban_cutoff\-th ban, it treats all objects as if they matched a ban and expurges them from cache. As actively used objects get tested against the ban list at request time and thus are likely to be associated with bans near the top of the ban list, with ban_cutoff, least recently accessed objects (the "long tail") are removed.
.sp
This parameter is a safety net to avoid bad response times due to bans being tested at lookup time. Setting a cutoff trades response time for cache efficiency. The recommended value is proportional to rate(bans_lurker_tests_tested) / n_objects while the ban lurker is working, which is the number of bans the system can sustain. The additional latency due to request ban testing is in the order of ban_cutoff / rate(bans_lurker_tests_tested). For example, for rate(bans_lurker_tests_tested) = 2M/s and a tolerable latency of 100ms, a good value for ban_cutoff may be 200K.

.sp
Worker thread stack size.
This will likely be rounded up to a multiple of 4k (or whatever the page_size might be) by the kernel.
.sp
The required stack size is primarily driven by the depth of the call\-tree. The most common relevant determining factors in varnish core code are GZIP (un)compression, ESI processing and regular expression matches. VMODs may also require significant amounts of additional stack. The nesting depth of VCL subs is another factor, although typically not predominant.
.sp
The stack size is per thread, so the maximum total memory required for worker thread stacks is in the order of size = thread_pools x thread_pool_max x thread_pool_stack.
.sp
Thus, in particular for setups with many threads, keeping the stack size at a minimum helps reduce the amount of memory required by Varnish.
.sp
On the other hand, thread_pool_stack must be large enough under all circumstances, otherwise varnish will crash due to a stack overflow. Usually, a stack overflow manifests itself as a segmentation fault (aka segfault / SIGSEGV) with the faulting address being near the stack pointer (sp).
.sp
Unless stack usage can be reduced, thread_pool_stack must be increased when a stack overflow occurs. Setting it in 150%\-200% increments is recommended until stack overflows cease to occur.

Number of worker thread pools.
.sp
Increasing the number of worker pools decreases lock contention. Each worker pool also has a thread accepting new connections, so for very high rates of incoming new connections on systems with many cores, increasing the worker pools may be required.
.sp
Too many pools waste CPU and RAM resources, and more than one pool for each CPU is most likely detrimental to performance.
