.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
varnishtest [\-hikLlqvW] [\-b size] [\-D name=val] [\-j jobs] [\-n iter] [\-t duration] file [file ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishtest program is a script driven program used to test the
Varnish Cache.
.sp
The varnishtest program, when started and given one or more script
files, can create a number of threads representing backends, some
threads representing clients, and a varnishd process. This is then used to
simulate a transaction to provoke a specific behavior.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-b \ size
Set internal buffer size (default: 1M)
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-D name=val      Define macro for use in scripts
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
Show help
.TP
.B \-i
Set PATH and vmod_path to find varnish binaries in build tree
.TP
.BI \-j \ jobs
Run this many tests in parallel
.TP
.B \-k
Continue on test failure
.TP
.B \-L
Always leave temporary vtc.*
.TP
.B \-l
Leave temporary vtc.* if test fails
.TP
.BI \-n \ iterations
Run tests this many times
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-p name=val      Pass parameters to all varnishd command lines
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode: report only failures
.TP
.BI \-t \ duration
Time tests out after this long (default: 60s)
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode: always report test log
.TP
.B \-W
Enable the witness facility for locking
.UNINDENT
.sp
file             File to use as a script
.sp
If \fITMPDIR\fP is set in the environment, varnishtest creates temporary
\fIvtc.*\fP directories for each test in \fI$TMPDIR\fP, otherwise in \fI/tmp\fP\&.
.SH SCRIPTS
.sp
The vtc syntax is documented at length in \fIvtc(7)\fP\&. Should you want more
examples than the one below, you can have a look at the Varnish source code
repository, under \fIbin/varnishtest/tests/\fP, where all the regression tests for
Varnish are kept.
.sp
An example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
varnishtest "#1029"

server s1 {
        rxreq
        expect req.url == "/bar"
        txresp \-gzipbody {[bar]}

        rxreq
        expect req.url == "/foo"
        txresp \-body {<h1>FOO<esi:include src="/bar"/>BARF</h1>}

} \-start

varnish v1 \-vcl+backend {
        sub vcl_backend_response {
                set beresp.do_esi = true;
                if (bereq.url == "/foo") {
                        set beresp.ttl = 0s;
                } else {
                        set beresp.ttl = 10m;
                }
        }
} \-start

client c1 {
        txreq \-url "/bar" \-hdr "Accept\-Encoding: gzip"
        rxresp
        gunzip
        expect resp.bodylen == 5

        txreq \-url "/foo" \-hdr "Accept\-Encoding: gzip"
        rxresp
        expect resp.bodylen == 21
} \-run

When run, the above script will simulate a server (s1) that expects
two different requests. It will start a Varnish server (v1) and add the
backend definition to the VCL specified (\-vcl+backend). Finally it starts
the c1\-client, which is a single client sending two requests.
.SH TESTING A BUILD TREE
.sp
Whether you are building a VMOD or trying to use one that you freshly
built, you can tell \fBvarnishtest\fP to pass a \fIvmod_path\fP to \fBvarnishd\fP
instances started using the \fBvarnish \-start\fP command in your test case:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
varnishtest \-p vmod_path=... /path/to/*.vtc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This way you can use the same test cases on both installed and built
VMODs:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
server s1 {...} \-start

varnish v1 \-vcl+backend {
    import wossname;

    ...
} \-start

\&...
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You are not limited to the \fIvmod_path\fP and can pass any parameter,
allowing you to run a build matrix without changing the test suite. You
can achieve the same with macros, but then they need to be defined on
each run.
.sp
You can see the actual \fBvarnishd\fP command lines in test outputs,
they look roughly like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
exec varnishd [varnishtest \-p params] [testing params] [vtc \-arg params]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Parameters you define with \fBvarnishtest \-p\fP may be overriden by
parameters needed by \fBvarnishtest\fP to run properly, and they may in
turn be overriden by parameters set in test scripts.
.sp
There\(aqs also a special mode in which \fBvarnishtest\fP builds itself a
PATH and a \fIvmod_path\fP in order to find Varnish binaries (programs and
VMODs) in the build tree surrounding the \fBvarnishtest\fP binary. This
is meant for testing of Varnish under development and will disregard
your \fIvmod_path\fP if you set one.
.sp
If you need to test your VMOD against a Varnish build tree, you must
install it first, in a temp directory for instance. With information
provided by the installation\(aqs \fIpkg\-config(1)\fP you can build a proper
PATH in order to access Varnish programs, and a \fIvmod_path\fP to access
both your VMOD and the built\-in VMODs:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/install/lib/pkgconfig

BINDIR="$(pkg\-config \-\-variable=bindir varnishapi)"
SBINDIR="$(pkg\-config \-\-variable=sbindir varnishapi)"
PATH="SBINDIR:BINDIR:$PATH"

VMODDIR="$(pkg\-config \-\-variable=vmoddir varnishapi)"
VMOD_PATH="/path/to/your/vmod/build/dir:$VMODDIR"

varnishtest \-p vmod_path="$VMOD_PATH" ...
