.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIvmod_directors\fP enables backend load balancing in Varnish.
.sp
The module implements load balancing techniques, and also serves as an
example on how one could extend the load balancing capabilities of
Varnish.
.sp
To enable load balancing you must import this vmod (directors).
.sp
Then you define your backends. Once you have the backends declared you
can add them to a director. This happens in executed VCL code. If you
want to emulate the previous behavior of Varnish 3.0 you can just
initialize the directors in \fBvcl_init{}\fP, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_init {
    new vdir = directors.round_robin();
    vdir.add_backend(backend1);
    vdir.add_backend(backend2);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you can see there is nothing keeping you from manipulating the
directors elsewhere in VCL. So, you could have VCL code that would add
more backends to a director when a certain URL is called.
.sp
Note that directors can use other directors as backends.
.SS new xround_robin = directors.round_robin()
.sp
Create a round robin director.
.sp
This director will pick backends in a round robin fashion.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
new vdir = directors.round_robin();
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.nf
.ft C
vdir.add_backend(backend1);
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS VOID xround_robin.remove_backend(BACKEND)
.sp
Remove a backend from the round\-robin director.

.sp
.nf
.ft C
vdir.remove_backend(backend1);
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.SS BACKEND xround_robin.backend()
.sp
Pick a backend from the director.
.sp

.nf
.ft C
set req.backend_hint = vdir.backend();
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS new xfallback = directors.fallback(BOOL sticky=0)
.sp
Create a fallback director.
.sp
A fallback director will try each of the added backends in turn, and
return the first one that is healthy.
.sp
If \fIsticky\fP is set to \fBtrue\fP, the director will keep using the
healthy backend, even if a higher\-priority backend becomes
available. Once the whole backend list is exhausted, it\(aqll start over
at the beginning.
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
new vdir = directors.fallback();
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS VOID xfallback.add_backend(BACKEND)

.sp
Create a random backend director.
.sp
The random director distributes load over the backends using a
weighted random probability distribution.
.sp
The "testable" random generator in varnishd is used, which enables
deterministic tests to be run (See: \fBd00004.vtc\fP).

.UNINDENT
.SS VOID xrandom.add_backend(BACKEND, REAL)
.sp
Add a backend to the director with a given weight.
.sp
Each backend will receive approximately 100 * (weight /
(sum(all_added_weights))) per cent of the traffic sent to this
director.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.SS new xshard = directors.shard()
.sp
Create a shard director.
.sp
Note that the shard director needs to be configured using at least one
\fI\%xshard.add_backend()\fP call(s) \fBfollowed by a\fP
\fI\%xshard.reconfigure()\fP \fBcall\fP before it can hand out
backends.
.sp
_Note_ that due to various restrictions (documented below), it is
recommended to use the shard director on the backend side.
.SS Introduction
.sp
The shard director selects backends by a key, which can be provided
directly or derived from strings. For the same key, the shard director
will always return the same backend, unless the backend configuration
or health state changes. Conversely, for differing keys, the shard
director will likely choose different backends. In the default
configuration, unhealthy backends are not selected.
.sp
The shard director resembles the hash director, but its main advantage
is that, when the backend configuration or health states change, the
association of keys to backends remains as stable as possible.
.sp
In addition, the rampup and warmup features can help to further
improve user\-perceived response times.
.SS Sharding
.sp
This basic technique allows for numerous applications like optimizing
backend server cache efficiency, Varnish clustering or persisting
sessions to servers without keeping any state, and, in particular,
without the need to synchronize state between nodes of a cluster of
Varnish servers:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Many applications use caches for data objects, so, in a cluster of
application servers, requesting similar objects from the same server
may help to optimize efficiency of such caches.
.sp
For example, sharding by URL or some \fIid\fP component of the url has
been shown to drastically improve the efficiency of many content
management systems.
.IP \(bu 2
As special case of the previous example, in clusters of Varnish
servers without additional request distribution logic, each cache
will need store all hot objects, so the effective cache size is
approximately the smallest cache size of any server in the cluster.
.sp
Sharding allows to segregate objects within the cluster such that
each object is only cached on one of the servers (or on one primary
and one backup, on a primary for long and others for short
etc...). Effectively, this will lead to a cache size in the order of
the sum of all individual caches, with the potential to drastically
increase efficiency (scales by the number of servers).
.IP \(bu 2
Another application is to implement persistence of backend requests,
such that all requests sharing a certain criterion (such as an IP
address or session ID) get forwarded to the same backend server.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When used with clusters of varnish servers, the shard director will,
if otherwise configured equally, make the same decision on all
servers. In other words, requests sharing a common criterion used as
the shard key will be balanced onto the same backend server(s) no
matter which Varnish server handles the request.
.sp
The drawbacks are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the distribution of requests depends on the number of requests per
key and the uniformity of the distribution of key values. In short,
while this technique may lead to much better efficiency overall, it
may also lead to less good load balancing for specific cases.
.IP \(bu 2
When a backend server becomes unavailable, every persistence
technique has to reselect a new backend server, but this technique
will also switch back to the preferred server once it becomes
healthy again, so when used for persistence, it is generally less
stable compared to stateful techniques (which would continue to use
a selected server for as long as possible (or dictated by a TTL)).
.UNINDENT
.SS Method
.sp
When \fI\%xshard.reconfigure()\fP is called, a consistent
hashing circular data structure gets built from the last 32 bits of
SHA256 hash values of \fI<ident>\fP\fI<n>\fP (default \fIident\fP being the
backend name) for each backend and for a running number \fIn\fP from 1 to
\fIreplicas\fP\&. Hashing creates the seemingly random order for placement
of backends on the consistent hashing ring.
.sp
When \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP is called, a load balancing key
gets generated unless provided. The smallest hash value in the circle
is looked up that is larger than the key (searching clockwise and
wrapping around as necessary). The backend for this hash value is the
preferred backend for the given key.
.sp
If a healthy backend is requested, the search is continued linearly on
the ring as long as backends found are unhealthy or all backends have
been checked. The order of these "alternative backends" on the ring is
likely to differ for different keys. Alternative backends can also be
selected explicitly.

This documentation uses the notion of an order of backends for a
particular shard key. This order is deterministic but seemingly random
as determined by the consistent hashing algorithm and is likely to
differ for different keys, depending on the number of backends and the
number of replicas. In particular, the backend order referred to here
is _not_ the order given when backends are added.

The following example is a typical use case: A parameter set is
associated with several directors. Director choice happens on the
client side and parameters are changed on the backend side to
implement retries on alternative backends:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_init {
  new shard_param = directors.shard_param();

  new dir_A = directors.shard();
  dir_A.add_backend(...);
  dir_A.reconfigure(shard_param);
  dir_A.associate(shard_param.use()); # <\-\- !

  new dir_B = directors.shard();
  dir_B.add_backend(...);
  dir_B.reconfigure(shard_param);
  dir_B.associate(shard_param.use()); # <\-\- !
}

sub vcl_recv {
  if (...) {
    set req.backend_hint = dir_A.backend(resolve=LAZY);
  } else {
    set req.backend_hint = dir_B.backend(resolve=LAZY);
  }
}

sub vcl_backend_fetch {
  # changes dir_A and dir_B behaviour
  shard_param.set(alt=bereq.retries);
}
.ft P

.SS VOID xshard_param.clear()
.sp
Reset the parameter set to default values as documented for
\fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
in \fBvcl_init{}\fP, resets the parameter set default for this VCL
.IP \(bu 2
in backend context, resets the parameter set for this backend
request to the VCL defaults

.sp
Change the given parameters of a parameter set as documented for
\fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
in \fBvcl_init{}\fP, changes the parameter set default for this VCL
.IP \(bu 2
in backend context, changes the parameter set for this backend
request, keeping the defaults set for this VCL for unspecified
arguments.

.SS STRING xshard_param.get_by()
.sp
Get a string representation of the \fIby\fP enum argument which denotes
how a shard director using this parameter object would derive the
shard key. See \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.SS INT xshard_param.get_key()
.sp
Get the key which a shard director using this parameter object would
use. See \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.SS INT xshard_param.get_alt()
.sp
Get the \fIalt\fP parameter which a shard director using this parameter
object would use. See \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.SS REAL xshard_param.get_warmup()
.sp
Get the \fIwarmup\fP parameter which a shard director using this parameter
object would use. See \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.SS BOOL xshard_param.get_rampup()
.sp
Get the \fIrampup\fP parameter which a shard director using this parameter
object would use. See \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.SS STRING xshard_param.get_healthy()
.sp
Get a string representation of the \fIhealthy\fP enum argument which a
shard director using this parameter object would use. See
\fI\%xshard.backend()\fP\&.
.SS BLOB xshard_param.use()
.sp
This method may only be used in backend context.
.sp
For use with the \fIparam\fP argument of \fI\%xshard.backend()\fP
to associate this shard parameter set with a shard director.
.SS BACKEND lookup(STRING)
.sp
Lookup a backend by its name.
.sp
This function can only be used from \fBvcl_init{}\fP and  \fBvcl_fini{}\fP\&.
