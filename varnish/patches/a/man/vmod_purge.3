.SH SYNOPSIS

import purge [as name] [from "path"]

INT hard()

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIvmod_purge\fP contains functions that offer a finer\-grained control
than \fBreturn(purge)\fP from \fBvcl_recv{}\fP\&. The functions can only be
called from \fBvcl_hit{}\fP or \fBvcl_miss{}\fP and they should in general
be used in both to ensure that all variants of a same object are taken
care of.
.SH EXAMPLE
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (client.ip !~ purge_acl) {
            return (synth(405));
        }
        return (hash);
    }
}

sub my_purge {
    set req.http.purged = purge.hard();
    if (req.http.purged == "0") {
        return (synth(404));
    }
    else {
        return (synth(200));
    }
}

sub vcl_hit {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        call my_purge;
    }
}

sub vcl_miss {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        call my_purge;
    }
}

sub vcl_synth {
    if (req.method == "PURGE") {
        if (req.http.purged) {
            set resp.http.purged = req.http.purged;
        }
        return (deliver);
    }
}

.SS INT hard()
.sp
This is equivalent to \fBreturn(purge)\fP but explicitly called from
\fBvcl_hit{}\fP and \fBvcl_miss{}\fP\&. It returns the number of purged
objects.
.sp

.INDENT 3.5

INT soft(DURATION ttl=0, DURATION grace=\-1, DURATION keep=\-1)
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sets the \fIttl\fP, \fIgrace\fP and \fIkeep\fP\&.
.sp
By default, \fIttl\fP is set to 0 with \fIgrace\fP and \fIkeep\fP periods left
untouched. Setting a negative value for \fIgrace\fP or \fIkeep\fP periods
leaves them untouched. Setting all three parameters to \fB0\fP is
equivalent to a hard purge. It can only be called from \fBvcl_hit{}\fP
or \fBvcl_miss{}\fP\&. It returns the number of soft\-purged objects.
