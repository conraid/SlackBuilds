.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
This document describes the syntax used by Varnish Test Cases files (.vtc).
A vtc file describe a scenario with different scripted HTTP\-talking entities,
and generally one or more Varnish instances to test.
.SH PARSING
.sp
A vtc file will be read word after word, with very little tokenization, meaning
a syntax error won\(aqt be detected until the test actually reach the relevant
action in the test.
.sp
A parsing error will most of the time result in an assert being triggered. If
this happens, please refer yourself to the related source file and line
number. However, this guide should help you avoid the most common mistakes.
.SS Words and strings
.sp
The parser splits words by detecting whitespace characters and a string is a
word, or a series of words on the same line enclosed by double\-quotes ("..."),
or, for multi\-line strings, enclosed in curly brackets ({...}).
.SS Comments
.sp
The leading whitespaces of lines are ignored. Empty lines (or ones consisting
only of whitespaces) are ignored too, as are the lines starting with "#" that
are comments.
.SS Lines and commands
.sp
Test files take at most one command per line, with the first word of the line
being the command and the following ones being its arguments. To continue over
to a new line without breaking the argument string, you can escape the newline
character (\en) with a backslash (\e).
.SH SYNTAX
.SS barrier
.sp
NOTE: This command is available everywhere commands are given.
.sp
Barriers allows you to synchronize different threads to make sure events
occur in the right order. It\(aqs even possible to use them in VCL.
.sp
First, it\(aqs necessary to declare the barrier:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
barrier bNAME TYPE NUMBER [\-cyclic]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With the arguments being:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B bNAME
this is the name of the barrier, used to identify it when you\(aqll
create sync points. It must start with \(aqb\(aq.
.TP
.B TYPE
it can be "cond" (mutex) or "sock" (socket) and sets internal
behavior. If you don\(aqt need VCL synchronization, use cond.
.TP
.B NUMBER
number of sync point needed to go through the barrier.
.TP
.B \-cyclic
if present, the barrier will reset itself and be ready for another
round once gotten through.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then, to add a sync point:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
barrier bNAME sync
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will block the parent thread until the number of sync points for bNAME
reaches the NUMBER given in the barrier declaration.
.sp
If you wish to synchronize the VCL, you need to declare a "sock" barrier.
This will emit a macro definition named "bNAME_sock" that you can use in
VCL (after importing the debug vmod):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
debug.barrier_sync("${bNAME_sock}");
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This function returns 0 if everything went well and is the equivalent of
\fBbarrier bNAME sync\fP at the VTC top\-level.
.SS client/server
.sp
Client and server threads are fake HTTP entities used to test your Varnish
and VCL. They take any number of arguments, and the one that are not
recognized, assuming they don\(aqt start with \(aq\-\(aq, are treated as
specifications, laying out the actions to undertake:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
client cNAME [...]
server sNAME [...]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Clients and server are identified by a string that\(aqs the first argument,
clients\(aq names start with \(aqc\(aq and servers\(aq names start with \(aqs\(aq.
.sp
As the client and server commands share a good deal of arguments and
specification actions, they are grouped in this single section, specific
items will be explicitly marked as such.
.SS Arguments
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-start
Start the thread in background, processing the last given
specification.
.TP
.B \-wait
Block until the thread finishes.
.TP
.B \-run (client only)
Equivalent to "\-start \-wait".
.TP
.B \-repeat NUMBER
Instead of processing the specification only once, do it NUMBER times.
.TP
.B \-keepalive
For repeat, do not open new connections but rather run all
iterations in the same connection
.TP
.B \-break (server only)
Stop the server.
.TP
.B \-listen STRING (server only)
Dictate the listening socket for the server. STRING is of the form
"IP PORT", or "/PATH/TO/SOCKET" for a Unix domain socket. In the
latter case, the path must begin with \(aq/\(aq, and the server must be
able to create it.
.TP
.B \-connect STRING (client only)
Indicate the server to connect to. STRING is also of the form
"IP PORT", or "/PATH/TO/SOCKET". As with "server \-listen", a
Unix domain socket is recognized when STRING begins with a \(aq/\(aq.
.TP
.B \-dispatch (server only, s0 only)
Normally, to keep things simple, server threads only handle one
connection at a time, but the \-dispatch switch allows to accept
any number of connection and handle them following the given spec.
.sp
However, \-dispatch is only allowed for the server name "s0".
.TP
.B \-proxy1 STRING (client only)
Use the PROXY protocol version 1 for this connection. STRING
is of the form "CLIENTIP:PORT SERVERIP:PORT".
.TP
.B \-proxy2 STRING (client only)
Use the PROXY protocol version 2 for this connection. STRING
is of the form "CLIENTIP:PORT SERVERIP:PORT".
.UNINDENT
.SS Macros and automatic behaviour
.sp
To make things easier in the general case, clients will connect by default
to the first Varnish server declared and the \-vcl+backend switch of the
\fBvarnish\fP command will add all the declared servers as backends.
.sp
Be careful though, servers will by default listen to the 127.0.0.1 IP and
will pick a random port, and publish 3 macros: sNAME_addr, sNAME_port and
sNAME_sock, but only once they are started.
For \(aqvarnish \-vcl+backend\(aq to create the vcl with the correct values, the
server must be started first.
.SS Specification
.sp
It\(aqs a string, either double\-quoted "like this", but most of the time
enclosed in curly brackets, allowing multilining. Write a command per line in
it, empty line are ignored, and long line can be wrapped by using a
backslash. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
client c1 {
    txreq \-url /foo \e
          \-hdr "bar: baz"

    rxresp
} \-run
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B accept (server only)
Close the current connection, if any, and accept a new one. Note
that this new connection is HTTP/1.x.
.TP
.B chunked STRING
Send STRING as chunked encoding.
.TP
.B chunkedlen NUMBER
Do as \fBchunked\fP except that the string will be generated
for you, with a length of NUMBER characters.
.TP
.B close (server only)
Close the connection. Note that if operating in HTTP/2 mode no
extra (GOAWAY) frame is sent, it\(aqs simply a TCP close.
.TP
.B expect STRING1 OP STRING2
Test if "STRING1 OP STRING2" is true, and if not, fails the test.
OP can be ==, <, <=, >, >= when STRING1 and STRING2 represent numbers
in which case it\(aqs an order operator. If STRING1 and STRING2 are
meant as strings OP is a matching operator, either == (exact match)
or ~ (regex match).
.sp
varnishtet will first try to resolve STRING1 and STRING2 by looking
if they have special meanings, in which case, the resolved value is
use for the test. Note that this value can be a string representing a
number, allowing for tests such as:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
expect req.http.x\-num > 2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here\(aqs the list of recognized strings, most should be obvious as they
either match VCL logic, or the txreq/txresp options:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
remote.ip
.IP \(bu 2
remote.port
.IP \(bu 2
remote.path
.IP \(bu 2
req.method
.IP \(bu 2
req.url
.IP \(bu 2
req.proto
.IP \(bu 2
resp.proto
.IP \(bu 2
resp.status
.IP \(bu 2
resp.reason
.IP \(bu 2
resp.chunklen
.IP \(bu 2
req.bodylen
.IP \(bu 2
req.body
.IP \(bu 2
resp.bodylen
.IP \(bu 2
resp.body
.IP \(bu 2
req.http.NAME
.IP \(bu 2
resp.http.NAME
.UNINDENT

.B expect_close
Reads from the connection, expecting nothing to read but an EOF.
.TP
.B fatal|non_fatal
Control whether a failure of this entity should stop the test.
.TP
.B gunzip
Gunzip the body in place.
.TP
.B loop NUMBER STRING
Process STRING as a specification, NUMBER times.
.TP
.B recv NUMBER
Read NUMBER bytes from the connection.
.TP
.B rxchunk
Receive an HTTP chunk.
.TP
.B rxpri (server only)
Receive a preface. If valid set the server to HTTP/2, abort
otherwise.
.TP
.B rxreq (server only)
Receive and parse a request\(aqs headers and body.
.TP
.B rxreqbody (server only)
Receive a request\(aqs body.
.TP
.B rxreqhdrs (server only)
Receive and parse a request\(aqs headers (but not the body).
.TP
.B rxresp [\-no_obj] (client only)
Receive and parse a response\(aqs headers and body. If \-no_obj is
present, only get the headers.
.TP
.B rxrespbody (client only)
Receive (part of) a response\(aqs body.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\-max : max length of this receive, 0 for all
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rxresphdrs (client only)
Receive and parse a response\(aqs headers.
.TP
.B send STRING
Push STRING on the connection.
.TP
.B send_n NUMBER STRING
Write STRING on the socket NUMBER times.
.TP
.B send_urgent STRING
Send string as TCP OOB urgent data. You will never need this.
.TP
.B sendhex STRING
Send bytes as described by STRING. STRING should consist of hex pairs
possibly separated by whitespace or newlines. For example:
"0F EE a5    3df2".
.TP
.B settings \-dectbl INT
Force internal HTTP/2 settings to certain values. Currently only
support setting the decoding table size.
.TP
.B shell
Same as for the top\-level shell.
.TP
.B stream
HTTP/2 introduces the concept of streams, and these come with
their own specification, and as it\(aqs quite big, have been moved
to their own chapter.
.TP
.B timeout NUMBER
Set the TCP timeout for this entity.
.TP
.B txpri (client only)
Send an HTTP/2 preface ("PRI * HTTP/2.0\er\en\er\enSM\er\en\er\en")
and set client to HTTP/2.
.TP
.B txreq|txresp [...]
Send a minimal request or response, but overload it if necessary.
.sp
txreq is client\-specific and txresp is server\-specific.
.sp
The only thing different between a request and a response, apart
from who can send them is that the first line (request line vs
status line), so all the options are prety much the same.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-method STRING (txreq only)
What method to use (default: "GET").
.TP
.B \-req STRING (txreq only)
Alias for \-method.

.TP
.B \-status NUMBER (txresp only)
What status code to return (default 200).
.TP
.B \-reason STRING (txresp only)
What message to put in the status line (default: "OK").
.UNINDENT
.sp
These three switches can appear in any order but must come before the
following ones.
.INDENT 7.0

.B \-nohost
Don\(aqt include a Host header in the request.
.TP
.B \-nolen

"name: value". It can be called multiple times.
.TP
.B \-hdrlen STRING NUMBER
Add STRING as a header with NUMBER bytes of content.
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can then use the arguments related to the body:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-body STRING
Input STRING as body.
.TP
.B \-bodyfrom FILE
Same as \-body but content is read from FILE.
.TP
.B \-bodylen NUMBER
Generate and input a body that is NUMBER bytes\-long.
.TP
.B \-gziplevel NUMBER
Set the gzip level (call it before any of the other gzip
switches).
.TP
.B \-gzipresidual NUMBER
Add extra gzip bits. You should never need it.
.TP
.B \-gzipbody STRING
Zip STRING and send it as body.
.TP
.B \-gziplen NUMBER
Combine \-body and \-gzipbody: create a body of length NUMBER,
zip it and send as body.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B write_body STRING
Write the body of a request or a response to a file. By using the
shell command, higher\-level checks on the body can be performed
(eg. XML, JSON, ...) provided that such checks can be delegated
to an external program.
.UNINDENT
.SS delay
.sp
NOTE: This command is available everywhere commands are given.
.sp
Sleep for the number of seconds specified in the argument. The number
can include a fractional part, e.g. 1.5.
.SS err_shell
.sp
NOTICE: err_shell is deprecated, use \fIshell \-err \-expect\fP instead.
.sp
This is very similar to the the \fBshell\fP command, except it takes a first
string as argument before the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
err_shell "foo" "echo foo"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
err_shell expect the shell command to fail AND stdout to match the string,
failing the test case otherwise.
.SS feature
.sp
Test that the required feature(s) for a test are available, and skip
the test otherwise; or change the interpretation of the test, as
documented below. feature takes any number of arguments from this list:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B SO_RCVTIMEO_WORKS
The SO_RCVTIMEO socket option is working
.TP
.B 64bit
The environment is 64 bits
.TP

.TP
.B ignore_unknown_macro
Do not fail the test if a string of the form ${...} is not
recognized as a macro.
.TP
.B persistent_storage
Varnish was built with the deprecated persistent storage.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Be careful with ignore_unknown_macro, because it may cause a test with a
misspelled macro to fail silently. You should only need it if you must
run a test with strings of the form "${...}".
.SS haproxy
.sp
Define and interact with haproxy instances.
.sp
To define a haproxy server, you\(aqll use this syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
haproxy hNAME \-conf\-OK CONFIG
haproxy hNAME \-conf\-BAD ERROR CONFIG
haproxy hNAME [\-D] [\-W] [\-arg STRING] [\-conf[+vcl] STRING]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first \fBhaproxy hNAME\fP invocation will start the haproxy master
process in the background, waiting for the \fB\-start\fP switch to actually
start the child.
.sp
Arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B hNAME
Identify the HAProxy server with a string, it must starts with \(aqh\(aq.
.TP

The exit code should be 0.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-conf\-BAD ERROR CONFIG
.INDENT 7.0
.TP

if OP is ~ or, on the contraty, if OP is !~ check that there is
no regex match.
.TP
.B send STRING
Push STRING on the CLI connection. STRING will be terminated by an
end of line character (n).
.UNINDENT
.SS logexpect
.sp
Reads the VSL and looks for records matching a given specification. It will
process records trying to match the first pattern, and when done, will
continue processing, trying to match the following pattern. If a pattern
isn\(aqt matched, the test will fail.
.sp
logexpect threads are declared this way:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
logexpect lNAME \-v <id> [\-g <grouping>] [\-d 0|1] [\-q query] \e
        [vsl arguments] {
                expect <skip> <vxid> <tag> <regex>
                expect <skip> <vxid> <tag> <regex>
                ...
        } [\-start|\-wait]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And once declared, you can start them, or wait on them:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
logexpect lNAME <\-start|\-wait>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

information.
.TP
.B \-d <0|1>
Start processing log records at the head of the log instead of the
tail.
.TP
.B \-q query
Filter records using a query expression, see \fBman vsl\-query\fP for
more information.
.TP
.B \-m
Also emit log records for misses (only for debugging)
.TP
.B \-start
Start the logexpect thread in the background.
.TP
.B \-wait
Wait for the logexpect thread to finish
.UNINDENT
.sp
VSL arguments (similar to the varnishlog options):
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b|\-c
Process only backend/client records.
.TP
.B \-C
Use caseless regex
.TP
.B \-i <taglist>
Include tags
.TP

And the arguments of the specifications lines are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B skip: [uint|*]
Max number of record to skip
.TP
.B vxid: [uint|*|=]
vxid to match
.TP
.B tag:  [tagname|*|=]
Tag to match against
.TP
.B regex:
regular expression to match against (optional)
.UNINDENT
.sp
For skip, vxid and tag, \(aq*\(aq matches anything, \(aq=\(aq expects the value of the
previous matched record.
.SS process
.sp
Run a process with stdin+stdout on a pseudo\-terminal and stderr on a pipe.
.sp
Output from the pseudo\-terminal is copied verbatim to ${pNAME_out},
and the \-log/\-dump/\-hexdump flags will also put it in the vtc\-log.
.sp
The pseudo\-terminal is not in ECHO mode, but if the programs run set
it to ECHO mode ("stty sane") any input sent to the process will also
appear in this stream because of the ECHO.
.sp
Output from the stderr\-pipe is copied verbatim to ${pNAME_err}, and
is always included in the vtc_log.
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B pNAME
Name of the process. It must start with \(aqp\(aq.
.TP
.B SPEC
The command(s) to run in this process.
.TP
.B \-hexdump
Log output with vtc_hexdump(). Must be before \-start/\-run.
.TP
.B \-dump
Log output with vtc_dump(). Must be before \-start/\-run.
.TP
.B \-log
Log output with VLU/vtc_log(). Must be before \-start/\-run.

.TP
.B \-wait
Wait for the process to finish.
.TP
.B \-run
Shorthand for \-start \-wait.
.sp
In most cases, if you just want to start a process and wait for it
to finish, you can use the \fBshell\fP command instead.
The following commands are equivalent:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell "do \-\-something"

process p1 "do \-\-something" \-run
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, you may use the the \fBprocess\fP variant to conveniently
collect the standard input and output without dealing with shell
redirections yourself. The \fBshell\fP command can also expect an
expression from either output, consider using it if you only need
to match one.
.TP
.B \-kill STRING
Send a signal to the process. The argument can be either
the string "TERM", "INT", or "KILL" for SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGKILL
signals, respectively, or a hyphen (\-) followed by the signal
number.
.sp
If you need to use other signal names, you can use the \fBkill\fP(1)
command directly:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell "kill \-USR1 ${pNAME_pid}"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that SIGHUP usage is discouraged in test cases.
.TP
.B \-stop
Shorthand for \-kill TERM.
.TP
.B \-write STRING
Write a string to the process\(aq stdin.
.TP
.B \-writeln STRING
Same as \-write followed by a newline (\en).
.TP
.B \-writehex HEXSTRING
Same as \-write but interpreted as hexadecimal bytes.
.TP
.B \-need\-bytes [+]NUMBER
Wait until at least NUMBER bytes have been received in total.
If \(aq+\(aq is prefixed, NUMBER new bytes must be received.
.TP
.B \-expect\-text LIN COL PAT
Wait for PAT to appear at LIN,COL on the virtual screen.
Lines and columns are numbered 1...N
LIN==0 means "on any line"
COL==0 means "anywhere on the line"
.TP
.B \-close
Alias for "\-kill HUP"
.TP
.B \-screen_dump
Dump the virtual screen into vtc_log
.UNINDENT
.SS setenv
.sp
Set or change an environment variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
setenv FOO "bar baz"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The above will set the environment variable $FOO to the value
provided. There is also an \fB\-ifunset\fP argument which will only
set the value if the the environment variable does not already
exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
setenv \-ifunset FOO quux
.ft P

Pass the string given as argument to a shell. If you have multiple
commands to run, you can use curly brackets to describe a multi\-lines
script, eg:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell {
        echo begin
        cat /etc/fstab
        echo end
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default a zero exit code is expected, otherwise the vtc will fail.
.sp
Notice that the commandstring is prefixed with "exec 2>&1;" to combine
stderr and stdout back to the test process.
.sp
Optional arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-err
Expect non\-zero exit code.
.TP
.B \-exit N
Expect exit code N instead of zero.
.TP
.B \-expect STRING
Expect string to be found in stdout+err.
.TP
.B \-match REGEXP
Expect regexp to match the stdout+err output.
.UNINDENT
.SS stream
.sp
(note: this section is at the top\-level for easier navigation, but
it\(aqs part of the client/server specification)
.sp
Streams map roughly to a request in HTTP/2, a request is sent on
stream N, the response too, then the stream is discarded. The main
exception is the first stream, 0, that serves as coordinator.
.sp
Stream syntax follow the client/server one:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
stream ID [SPEC] [ACTION]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
ID is the HTTP/2 stream number, while SPEC describes what will be
done in that stream.
.sp
Note that, when parsing a stream action, if the entity isn\(aqt operating
in HTTP/2 mode, these spec is ran before:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
txpri/rxpri # client/server
stream 0 {
    txsettings
    rxsettings
    txsettings \-ack
    rxsettings
    expect settings.ack == true
} \-run
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And HTTP/2 mode is then activated before parsing the specification.
.SS Actions
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-start
Run the specification in a thread, giving back control immediately.
.TP
.B \-wait
Wait for the started thread to finish running the spec.
.TP
.B \-run

.UNINDENT
.SS Specification
.sp
The specification of a stream follows the exact same rules as one for a
client or a server.
.SS txreq, txresp, txcont, txpush
.sp
These four commands are about sending headers. txreq and txresp
will send HEADER frames; txcont will send CONTINUATION frames; txpush
PUSH frames.
The only difference between txreq and txresp are the default headers
set by each of them.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-noadd
Do not add default headers. Useful to avoid duplicates when sending
default headers using \fB\-hdr\fP, \fB\-idxHdr\fP and \fB\-litIdxHdr\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-status INT (txresp)
Set the :status pseudo\-header.
.TP
.B \-url STRING (txreq, txpush)
Set the :path pseudo\-header.
.TP
.B \-method STRING (txreq, txpush)
Set the :method pseudo\-header.
.TP
.B \-req STRING (txreq, txpush)

.TP
.B \-scheme STRING (txreq, txpush)
Set the :scheme pseudo\-header.
.TP
.B \-hdr STRING1 STRING2
Insert a header, STRING1 being the name, and STRING2 the value.
.TP
.B \-idxHdr INT
Insert an indexed header, using INT as index.
.TP
.B \-litIdxHdr inc|not|never INT huf|plain STRING
Insert an literal, indexed header. The first argument specify if the
header should be added to the table, shouldn\(aqt, or mustn\(aqt be
compressed if/when retransmitted.
.sp
INT is the idex of the header name to use.
.sp
The third argument informs about the Huffman encoding: yes (huf) or
no (plain).
.sp
The last term is the literal value of the header.
.TP
.B \-litHdr inc|not|never huf|plain STRING1 huf|plain STRING2
Insert a literal header, with the same first argument as
\fB\-litIdxHdr\fP\&.
.sp
The second and third terms tell what the name of the header is and if
it should be Huffman\-encoded, while the last two do the same
regarding the value.
.TP
.B \-body STRING (txreq, txresp)
Specify a body, effectively putting STRING into a DATA frame after
the HEADER frame is sent.
.TP
.B \-bodyfrom FILE (txreq, txresp)
Same as \fB\-body\fP but content is read from FILE.
.TP
.B \-bodylen INT (txreq, txresp)
Do the same thing as \fB\-body\fP but generate an string of INT length
for you.
.TP
.B \-gzipbody STRING (txreq, txresp)
Gzip STRING and send it as body.
.TP
.B \-gziplen NUMBER (txreq, txresp)
Combine \-body and \-gzipbody: create a body of length NUMBER,
gzip it and send as body.
.TP

Don\(aqt set the END_STREAM flag automatically, making the peer expect
a body after the headers.
.TP

more HEADER frames.
.TP
.B \-dep INT (txreq, txresp)
Tell the peer that this content depends on the stream with the INT
id.
.TP
.B \-ex (txreq, txresp)
Make the dependency exclusive (\fB\-dep\fP is still needed).
.TP
.B \-weight (txreq, txresp)
Set the weight for the dependency.
.TP
.B \-promised INT (txpush)
The id of the promised stream.
.TP
.B \-pad STRING / \-padlen INT (txreq, txresp, txpush)

\-pad, or one that is generated for you, of length INT is \-padlen
case.
.UNINDENT
.SS txdata
.sp
By default, data frames are empty. The receiving end will know the whole body
has been delivered thanks to the END_STREAM flag set in the last DATA frame,
and txdata automatically set it.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP

Data to be embedded into the frame.
.TP
.B \-datalen INT
Generate and INT\-bytes long string to be sent in the frame.

case.
.TP
.B \-nostrend
Don\(aqt set the END_STREAM flag, allowing to send more data on this
stream.
.UNINDENT
.SS rxreq, rxresp
