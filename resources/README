Resources is a simple yet powerful monitor for your system resources
and processes, written in Rust and using GTK 4 and libadwaita for its
GUI. It's capable of displaying usage and details of your CPU,
memory, GPUs, network interfaces and block devices. It's also capable
of listing and terminating running graphical applications as well
as processes.
