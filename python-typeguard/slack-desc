# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-typeguard: python-typeguard (Run-time type checker for Python)
python-typeguard:
python-typeguard: This library provides run-time type checking for functions defined
python-typeguard: with PEP 484 argument (and return) type annotations, and any arbitrary
python-typeguard: Python objects. It can be used together with static type checkers as
python-typeguard: an additional layer of type safety, to catch type violations that
python-typeguard: could only be detected at run time.
