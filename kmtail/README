kmtail (KDE4 tail program)

KmTail is a KDE4 version of the venerable Ktail program. It has
pretty much the same features and allows you to monitor various log
files.
Note that most files in /var/log are only root-readable so
you will have to start KmTail with kdesu or, much better, configure
syslog-ng to use more convenient permissions.
