ModSecurity (ModSecurity v3 Nginx Connector)

The ModSecurity-nginx connector is the connection point between
Nginx and libmodsecurity (ModSecurity v3). Said another way, this
project provides a communication channel between Nginx and
libmodsecurity. This connector is required to use LibModSecurity
with Nginx.
