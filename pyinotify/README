pyinotify (Monitoring filesystems events)

Pyinotify is a Python module for monitoring filesystems changes.
Pyinotify relies on a Linux Kernel feature (merged in kernel 2.6.13)
called inotify. inotify is an event-driven notifier, its notifications
are exported from kernel space to user space through three system
calls. pyinotify binds these system calls and provides an
implementation on top of them offering a generic and abstract way
to manipulate those functionalities.
