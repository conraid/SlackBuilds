yapet (Password Encryption Tool)

YAPET is a curses based password encryption tool using the Blowfish
encryption algorithm to store the password records encrypted on disk.
Its primary aim is to provide a safe way to store passwords in a file
on disk while having a small footprint, and compiling and running
under today's most popular Unix, such as Solaris, FreeBSD, and Linux.
