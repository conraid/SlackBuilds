dwdiff (word-level diff program)

dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level instead of
the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows the
user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that
it takes an optional list of characters that should be considered
delimiters. Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if
they are words, even when there is no whitespace separating them
from preceding words or delimiters.
