range-v3 (C++ Range Library)

Range library for C++14/17/20. This code was the basis of a formal
proposal to add range support to the C++ standard library. That
proposal evolved through a Technical Specification, and finally into
P0896R4 "The One Ranges Proposal" which was merged into the C++20
working drafts in November 2018.
