# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

range-v3: range-v3 (C++ Range Library)
range-v3:
range-v3: Range library for C++14/17/20. This code was the basis of a formal
range-v3: proposal to add range support to the C++ standard library. That
range-v3: proposal evolved through a Technical Specification, and finally into
range-v3: P0896R4 "The One Ranges Proposal" which was merged into the C++20
range-v3: working drafts in November 2018.
