keepassxc (KeePass Cross-Platform Community Edition)

KeePassXC is a community fork of KeePassX, the cross-platform port
of KeePass for Windows. Every feature works cross-platform and was
thoroughly tested on multiple systems to provide users with the same
look and feel on every supported operating system. This includes
the beloved Auto-Type feature.
