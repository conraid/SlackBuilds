python-tornado (web framework and asynchronous networking library)

Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library,
originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O,
Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it
ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that
require a long-lived connection to each user.
