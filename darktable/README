darktable (digital photography application)

Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers.
It manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
them through a zoomable lighttable. It also enables you to develop
raw images and enhance them. This project tries to fill the gap
between the many excellent existing free raw converters and image
management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
