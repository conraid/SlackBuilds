=== JACK Servers in this Package ===

This package includes both the classic JACK server ("jackd") and the D-Bus enabled server ("jackdbus").
You can choose which one to use depending on your workflow.

== Classic JACK ("jackd") ==

- Uses the traditional `.jackdrc` configuration file.
- Recommended if you prefer manual control or use `qjackctl` in classic mode.
- Example to start:

# jackd -d alsa -d hw:0

== D-Bus JACK ("jackdbus") ==

D-Bus JACK provides integration with desktop environments and tools like `qjackctl`.

**Important notes:**

- ".jackdrc" and some classic "qjackctl" settings are ignored.

**Example to start D-Bus JACK:**

# jack_control start

== IMPORTANT ==

**Do not run "jackd" and "jackdbus" at the same time**
  this may cause conflicts accessing the audio hardware.
