node-sass (Wrapper around libsass)

node-sass is a library that provides binding for Node.js to libsass,
the C version of the popular stylesheet preprocessor, Sass.

HOME: https://github.com/sass/node-sass

======================================================================
NOTE: 

To build libsass binding delete /root/.npm directory.

Otherwise the binding is not built, and so you have to download 
binding.node file from https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/download/

======================
REQUIRES: node-gyp node-nan
