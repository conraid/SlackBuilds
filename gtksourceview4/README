GtkSourceView is a GNOME library that extends GtkTextView, the
standard GTK+ widget for multiline text editing. GtkSourceView adds
support for syntax highlighting, undo/redo, file loading and saving,
search and replace, a completion system, printing, displaying line
numbers, and other features typical of a source code editor.
