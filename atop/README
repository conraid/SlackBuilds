NOTE: 

README.SLACKWARE for atop

Some features depend on the 'acct' (BSD accounting) package from 
Slackware being installed.  To enable it, execute the following:

  touch /var/log/pacct
  chgrp utmp /var/log/pacct
  chmod 640 /var/log/pacct
  accton

You may want to have atop start at boot; to do so, add to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local the following lines:

  # Start the accounting top service
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.atop ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.atop
  fi
