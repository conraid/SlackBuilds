# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libnice: nice
libnice:
libnice: Nice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactive Connectivity
libnice: Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based library, libnice.
libnice: ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP
libnice: data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides
libnice: security against some attacks. Existing standards that use ICE include
libnice: the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Jingle, XMPP extension for
libnice: audio/video calls.
