Shorewall-core (Core Shorewall libraries)

The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall",
is a Netfilter (iptables) based firewall that can be used on
a dedicated firewall system, a multi-function gateway /
router / server, or on a standalone GNU/Linux system.

This package contains common files required by both the
shorewall and shorewall6 components of Shorewall.

======================================================================
NOTE: 


shorewall consists of 3 packages:
* shorewall-core, containing the common elements to both IPv4 and IPv6 components
* shorewall, the IPv4 component
* shorewall6, the IPv6 component

The shorewall-core package is needed for both,
but you must install at least one of the other two,
depending on your network type.
