yara (The pattern matching swiss knife)

YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware
researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you
can create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to
describe) based on textual or binary patterns. Each description,
a.k.a rule, consists of a set of strings and a boolean expression
which determine its logic.
