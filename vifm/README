Vifm (a ncurses-based file manager with vi-like keybindings)

If you use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your
files without having to learn a new set of commands.
The configuration for vifm sits in ~/.vifm.

A vifm.vim plugin is included in /usr/doc/vifm-$VERSION. Read the
INSTALL file there for usage information.
