sqlitebrowser (QT GUI editor for SQLite databases)

DB Browser for SQLite is a high quality, visual, open source tool to
create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.
It is for users and developers wanting to create databases, search,
and edit data. It uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and
you don't need to learn complicated SQL commands.
