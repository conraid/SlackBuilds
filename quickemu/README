quickemu (Quickly create and run optimised virtual machines)

Quickly create and run optimised Windows, macOS and Linux desktop
virtual machines.
Quickemu is a wrapper for the excellent QEMU that attempts to
automatically "do the right thing", rather than expose exhaustive
configuration options. You decide what operating system you want to
run, and Quickemu will figure out the best way to do it for you.
