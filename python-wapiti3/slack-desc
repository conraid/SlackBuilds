# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-wapiti3: Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications. It
python-wapiti3: performs “black-box” scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of
python-wapiti3: the application but will scans the webpages of the deployed webapp,
python-wapiti3: looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data. Once it gets
python-wapiti3: this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see if a
