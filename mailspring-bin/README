mailspring-bin (Email client)

Mailspring is a new version of Nylas Mail maintained by one of the
original authors. It's faster, leaner, and shipping today! It replaces
the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine
based on Mailcore2. It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail
and idles with almost zero "CPU Wakes", which translates to great
battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other
great new features.

THIS IS A REPACKAGING OF THE DEB PACKAGE.
