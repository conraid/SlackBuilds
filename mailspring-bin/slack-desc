# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mailspring-bin: based on Mailcore2. It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail
mailspring-bin: and idles with almost zero "CPU Wakes", which translates to great
mailspring-bin: battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other
mailspring-bin: great new features.
