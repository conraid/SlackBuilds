lazyssh (termin-based, interactive SSH manager)

Lazyssh is a terminal-based, interactive SSH manager built for
managing your fleet of servers directly from your terminal.
With lazyssh, you can quickly navigate, connect, manage, and transfer
files between your local machine and any server defined in your
~/.ssh/config. No more remembering IP addresses or running long scp
commands — just a clean, keyboard-driven UI.
