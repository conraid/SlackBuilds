fping  (a ping like program to send ICMP echo requests)

fping is a ping(1) like program which uses the Internet Control
Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to determine if a host is up. 
fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of 
hosts on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists of
hosts to ping.
