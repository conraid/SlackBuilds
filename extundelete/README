extundelete (utility to undelete files from ext3/4 partition)

extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3
or ext4 partition. extundelete uses information stored in the
partition's journal to attempt to recover a file that has been
deleted from the partition.
There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able to be
undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system in place,
or at least put one in place after recovering your files!
