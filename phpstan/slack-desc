# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

phpstan: PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code without actually
phpstan: running it. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write
phpstan: tests for the code. It moves PHP closer to compiled languages in the
phpstan: sense that the correctness of each line of the code can be checked
phpstan: before you run the actual line.
