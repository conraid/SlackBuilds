p0f (passive os fingerprint tool)

p0f is a passive operating system fingerprinting tool.  It can
identify the OS on machines that connect to your box, machines you
connect to, machines you cannot connect to, and machines whose
communications you can observe.  It can detect or measure firewall
presence, NAT use, existence of a load balancer setup, the distance
to the remote system, its uptime, and its network hookup and ISP.
