# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

phpstan-bin: PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code without actually
phpstan-bin: running it. It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write
phpstan-bin: tests for the code. It moves PHP closer to compiled languages in the
phpstan-bin: sense that the correctness of each line of the code can be checked
phpstan-bin: before you run the actual line.
