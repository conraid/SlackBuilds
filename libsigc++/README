libsigc++ (typesafe callback system for standard C++)

libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++.
It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
callback function, either global or a member function, regardless
of whether it is static or virtual.
It also contains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar
callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback
libraries.
