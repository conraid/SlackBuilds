ngrep (network grep)

ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features,
applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that
will allow you to specify extended regular or hexadecimal expressions
to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes
IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP,
FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter
logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools,
such as tcpdump and snoop.
