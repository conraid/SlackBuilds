Shorewall6 (An IPv6 iptables-based firewall for Linux systems)

The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is a
Netfilter (iptables) based firewall that can be used on a dedicated
firewall system, a multi-function gateway/router/server or on a
standalone GNU/Linux system.

This package provides the IPv6 components for shorewall.

======================================================================
NOTE: 


shorewall consists of 3 packages:
* shorewall-core, containing the common elements to both IPv4 and IPv6 components
* shorewall, the IPv4 component
* shorewall6, the IPv6 component

The shorewall-core package is needed for both,
but you must install at least one of the other two,
depending on your network type.
