I created the package for Celeste, a GUI for rclone to use cloud services
that may not have their own programs for Linux, such as proton.
However, I remind you that if you want, there is filen,
which has software for Linux, and if you activate it from this link,
they give us 10 GB each: https://filen.io/r/996b5eff3ae5dfa85e47bef5be8c4f52

Recompiled OpenCV to complete G’MIC build; otherwise, it failed.
Appears to work at runtime, but not fully guaranteed.
OpenCV might need recompiling with the new OpenEXR version,
though forum discussions suggest otherwise.
I’m not engaging in forum debates due to health reasons.
In addition, for some software I had to create patches
(not all of them, I found some in their git)
so that only the headers would be detected,
not the boost_system libraries. Let me know if everything is OK.

Found a European encrypted cloud service, GDPR compliant: https://filen.io/
Created two packages for it; later I might create an rc.filen script to start
synchronization with some local directories at boot.
For now, take them as they are and let me know if they’re fine.
In the meantime, if you want to sign up, use this link — we’ll both get 10 GB each:
https://filen.io/r/996b5eff3ae5dfa85e47bef5be8c4f52
Happy Slack! Let me know how it works for you!
