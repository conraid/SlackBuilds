netsniff-ng (High performance network sniffer)

netsniff-ng is a high performance linux network sniffer for packet
inspection. Basically, it is similar to tcpdump, but it doesn't need
one syscall per packet. Instead, it uses an memory mapped area within
kernelspace for accessing packets without copying them to userspace.
