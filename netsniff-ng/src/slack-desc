# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netsniff-ng: netsniff-ng is a high performance linux network sniffer for packet
netsniff-ng: inspection. Basically, it is similar to tcpdump, but it doesn't need
netsniff-ng: one syscall per packet. Instead, it uses an memory mapped area within
netsniff-ng: kernelspace for accessing packets without copying them to userspace.
