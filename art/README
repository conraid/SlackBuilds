art (The ART raw image processor)

ART is a free, open-source, cross-platform raw image processing
program. ART is a derivative of the popular RawTherapee, trading a
bit of customization and control over various processing parameters
for a simpler and (hopefully) easier to use interface, while still
maintaining the power and quality of RawTherapee.
