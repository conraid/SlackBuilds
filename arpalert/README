arpalert (monitoring ethernet networks)

Arpalert listens on a network interface (without using 'promiscuous' 
mode) and catches all conversations of MAC address to IP request.
It then compares the mac addresses it detected with a pre-configured
list of authorized MAC addresses. If the MAC is not in list, arpalert
launches a pre-defined user script with the MAC address and IP address
as parameters.
