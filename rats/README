This is RATS, a rough auditing tool for security, originally
developed by Secure Software Inc. It is a tool for scanning C, C++,
Perl, PHP, Python (and soon Ruby) source code and flagging common
security related programming errors such as buffer overflows and
TOCTOU (Time Of Check, Time Of Use) race conditions.
