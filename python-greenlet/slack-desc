# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python-greenlet: CPython that supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run
python-greenlet: pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)
python-greenlet: and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".
python-greenlet:
python-greenlet: Greenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent
python-greenlet: programming. They are provided as a C extension module for the
python-greenlet: regular unmodified interpreter.
