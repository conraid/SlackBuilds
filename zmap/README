zmap (Network scanner for Internet-wide network surveys)

ZMap is an open-source network scanner that enables researchers to
easily perform Internet-wide network studies. With a single machine
and a well provisioned network uplink, ZMap is capable of performing
a complete scan of the IPv4 address space in under 45 minutes,
approaching the theoretical limit of gigabit Ethernet.
