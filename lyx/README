LyX (WYSIWYM document processor)

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing 
based on the structure of your documents (WYSIWYM).
LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of 
use of a graphical interface. This results in world-class support for 
creation of mathematical content and structured documents like
academic articles, theses, and books. In addition, staples of
scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation come
standard.
