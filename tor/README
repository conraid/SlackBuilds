tor (The onion router)

Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that 
want to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor 
can help you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging,
IRC, SSH, and other applications that use the TCP protocol. Tor also
provides a platform on which software developers can build new
applications with built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.
