device-tree-compiler (Device Tree Compiler for Flat Device Trees)

Device Tree Compiler, 'dtc', transforms a textual description of a
device tree ('DTS') into a binary object ('DTB').

DTS is most commonly used on embedded platforms.

This tool is particularly useful for building a DTS-enabled 'U-Boot'
binary.
