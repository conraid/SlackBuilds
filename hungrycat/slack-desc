# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

hungrycat: hungrycat is a tool that prints the contents of a file on the
hungrycat: standard output while simultaneously freeing disk space occupied
hungrycat: by the file. It can be useful if you need to process a large file,
hungrycat: but you don't have enough space to store the output file,
hungrycat: and you won't need the input file afterward.
