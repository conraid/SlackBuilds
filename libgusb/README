libgusb (Glib Wrapper)

GUsb is a GObject wrapper for libusb1 that makes it easy to do
asynchronous control, bulk and interrupt transfers with proper
cancellation and integration into a mainloop.

This makes it easy to integrate low level USB transfers with your
high-level application or system daemon.
