python-dill ( serializing and de-serializing python objects)

dill extends python's pickle module for serializing and
de-serializing python objects to the majority of the built-in python
types. Serialization is the process of converting an obkect to a byte
stream, and the inverse of which is converting a byte stream back
to a python object hierarchy.
