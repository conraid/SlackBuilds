chkrootkit (Check Rootkit) 

chkrootkit is a common unix-based program intended to help system 
administrators check their system for known rootkits. It is a shell
script using common UNIX/Linux tools like the strings and grep 
commands to search core system programs for signatures and for 
comparing a traversal of the /proc filesystem with the output of  
the ps (process status) command to look for discrepancies.
