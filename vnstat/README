vnStat (a console-based network traffic monitor)

vnStat is a network traffic monitor for Linux that keeps a log of
daily network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnStat isn't a
packetsniffer. The traffic information is analyzed from the /proc
filesystem so vnStat can be used without root permissions. This
program is open source (GPL) and can be installed in 'single' and
'root' mode.
