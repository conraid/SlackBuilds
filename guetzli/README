guetzli (Perceptual JPEG encoder)

Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density
at high visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30%
smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg.
uetzli. Guetzli generates only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to
faster decompression speeds they offer.
