Tellico (KDE application for keeping track of your collections)

Tellico is a KDE application for keeping track of your collections.
It provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos, 
music, coins, stamps, trading cards, comic books, and wines.
Ultimately, the goal is for it to be similar in capability to 
AVCataloger or Readerware, although it's still got a ways to go.
