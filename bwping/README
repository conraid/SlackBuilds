BWPing (tool to measure bandwidth)

BWPing is a tool to measure bandwidth and response times between two
hosts using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
echo request/echo reply mechanism.
It does not require any special software on the remote host.
The only requirement is the ability to respond on ICMP echo request
messages. BWPing supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
