# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

opensc:
opensc: OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart
opensc: cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic
opensc: operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as
opensc: authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC
opensc: implements the standard APIs to smart cards, e.g. PKCS#11 API,
