lshw (Hardware Lister)

lshw (Hardware Lister) is a small tool to provide detailed information
on the hardware configuration of the machine. It can report exact
memory configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU
version and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc. on
DMI-capable x86 or EFI (IA-64) systems and on some PowerPC machines.
