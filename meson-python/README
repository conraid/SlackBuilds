meson-python (Meson PEP 517 Python build backend)

meson-python is a Python build backend built on top of the Meson
build system. It enables to use Meson for the configuration and build
steps of Python packages. Meson is an open source build system meant
to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user
friendly as possible. meson-python is best suited for building Python
packages containing extension modules implemented in languages such
as C, C++, Cython, Fortran, Pythran, or Rust.
